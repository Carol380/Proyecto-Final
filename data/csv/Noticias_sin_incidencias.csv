Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. According to Kara, Pope Francis strongly disagreed with the resolution. He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel, the deputy minister stressed. As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe.

10020|Bombshell: 2006 audio of Hillary Clinton proposing rigging Palestine election|Print For thos who stubbornly insist that the words election and rig have never been uttered in the same sentence by wannabe president Hillary Clinton, a little sound bite you might have trouble making sense of. The recording was made on September 5, 2006, by an editor of the Jewish Press, during a meeting with Clinton in her race for re-election to the U.S. Senator. Via The Observer : The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to [Editor Eli] Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. Speaking about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). In the clip, which appears below, Clinton can be heard plainly saying: I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.|2022-09-11 13:00:00|FAKE|Grace Liu|City Beat|863442|44455|159|4623|Mexico|English|2022-09-08 06:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|601200|885600|1275|2.65
10021|If You Have One Of These Old VHS Tapes It May Be Worth Over $1000|posted by Eddie Got VHS tapes collecting dust on a shelf somewhere? Maybe you already reclaimed the space and sitting in an attic long-forgotten. Hopefully you throw them out, though, as it turns out there might be quite the market for some old tapes. Modern directorial practice for movie releases and re-releases tends to include adding or editing the film from the theatrical version. While some people mind or even enjoy these changes, for others, the original cut is worth a hefty price tag. This translates to listings on eBay for certain tapes at astronomical prices, like one particular Beauty and the Beast tape going for $9,999. The original Beauty and the Beast did not include the song Human Again; it was cut for space reasons, then re-added to the 2002 special edition. However, Disney tapes in particular might be valuable to collectors for other reasons. Reddit user Reddit_Executive speculates that, because of the specific branding on original releases, these movies could go for quite a bit: On the spines of some VHS (and BetaMax) tapes is a black diamond with signature on it. This was first attempt to market their videos to homes. Because of this, certain Disney collectors are convinced that these VHS tapes are worth something. While possible some tapes are indeed worth quite a bit, many of the movies listed are actually selling for much less. Still, if your plan for your old VHS tapes begins and ends with trash them, no harm in doing your research on what they might be worth.

An email penned by Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin to Director of Communications, Jennifer Palmieri, and a few others, calling immediate attention to a tweet by journalist Katherine Miller paints an entirely different picture. Miller tweeted a snippet of the aforementioned interview in which Plante asked Obama, Mr. President, When did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. Government for official business while she was Secretary of State?

This afternoon , WikiLeaks says sources in the Clinton Foundation inadvertently leaked the details of an apparently secret deal with International Real Estate in New York. Several recorded phone conversations between executives and Clinton board member, FrankGuistra, clearly show that a deal for The Imperial Maldives had been closed. The Imperial Maldives is a development of 185 water villas set above the turquoise waters of the North Male Atoll. According to the recordings, the agreed price was $200 million (U.S). Also according to the recordings, this deal began the morning after the last debate. The morning after Trump told Clinton he would appoint a special prosecutor and put her in prison. Mr. Guistra is heard to say, Trump can drag his sorry orange ass down to the Maldives if he wants her so bad. no extradition treaty! [laughing] The Clinton camp is very tight-lipped at the moment and no comments from Clinton Foundation board members. WikiLeaks seems to suggest that the Clintons are feeling the pressure of a world-wide criminal organization becoming frayed at the seams, and are looking for a hideout until they can hatch their next diabolical plan for world domination.

1006|Could This Be the Real 'Super Tuesday'? A Look at What's at Stake|"It's a big primary day in the race for the White House, with Donald Trump trying to lock down his GOP frontrunner status. Democrat Hillary Clinton is trying to do the same. ""Super Tuesday 2,"" as some are calling it, is a day that could be the critical turning point in the race for president: there'll be contests in five states, including the delegate-rich, winner-take-all states of Florida and Ohio. ""This is a place I want to win. This is the place, this is going to do it,"" said Trump, who was in Ohio overnight attacking its governor and his rival John Kasich. The two are neck-and-neck in the polls there. ""Kasich cannot make America great again,"" Trump said. ""He can't do it."" If Trump loses Ohio, some analysts believe that when the Republicans meet in Cleveland it could be a contested convention. If Kasich loses, he's likely out of the race. Nevertheless, the ""Stop Trump"" movement was in full effect, with the billionaire's rivals spending Monday reminding voters of the recent violence at some of Trump's rallies. ""This country is not about us tearing one another down,"" Kasich said. ""Oh look, a Bernie Sanders sign,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., noted at one of his rallies. ""Don't worry, you're not going to get beat up at my rally."" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said, ""One difference between this and a Donald Trump rally is I'm not asking anyone to punch you in the face."" But Trump insisted, ""There's no violence. There's a love fest. These are love fests."" Meanwhile in Florida, Rubio is determined to claim victory in his winner-take-all home state, despite polling behind Trump in some cases by more than 20 points. And in Charlotte, North Carolina, Clinton was blaming Trump for the violence at his rallies. ""I do call him responsible. I think if you go back several months, he's been building this incitement,"" she charged. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was in Illinois, far behind in the delegate count but confident and getting much closer in the polls in recent days. ""Let us see this great state lead this country into a political revolution,"" he told supporters. Clinton holds a wide lead in Florida and North Carolina, but recent polls show a tight race in Missouri and Sanders narrowing her advantage in Illinois and Ohio."|2022-10-09 17:00:00|REAL|Xavier Chang|The Informer|837544|13441|257|4364|Ukraine|English|2022-09-21 14:00:00|Reportaje especial|0|True|1753200|3319200|2243|4.283333333333333

10062|FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal|FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield The FBI has an early present for Hillary Clinton. It's the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Marc Rich. His prosecutor? James Comey. The FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Bill pardon of Marc Rich, who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. The unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. Well of course it did. It's never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. The investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Clinton made on the last day of his presidency in 2001, that of financier and international fugitive Marc Rich, whose ex-wife Denise had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Clinton Foundation. And there's a surprise guest. While the files may seem dated, they invoke figures beyond the Clintons who went on to play key roles in official Washington -- including Comey. He served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Rich from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002, Comey took over a criminal investigation of pardons. I was stunned at the Rich pardon, Comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. Clinton's people are fuming, but it was a standard FIOA request and there's nothing big here. It's just one of those things the Clintons should have gone to jail for. But didn't.

10074|Clinton Campaign Circulated Paul Ryan Relative as Possible Supreme Court Pick|Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage campaign? Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 Hillary campaign circulated the name of one of Paul relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair), reads the email. Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan. Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?

10087|Teachers Strike Allowing Children To Sample The Kind Of Free Time They’ll Have On The Dole|0 Add Comment WITH 400 schools shut and 200,000 students not attending lessons, striking teachers have provided children with an insight into what their life will be like on the dole after they leave school. It obviously the intention, but an interesting lesson for my three lads, sitting around on the couch, bored out of their holes thinking this it? Is this all I can basically the dole like. Things being largely out of your control. Good to get training in early, shared concerned parent Olwyn Nelligan. As youth unemployment remains worryingly high in Ireland at over 15%, teachers striking for better pay have inadvertently given their students a window into what life will be like post-second level education for many of them as despite being keen to learn and further themselves all they have is free time on their hands. Teachers are striking for better pay, and if they were granted it, it would could serve as a way for the government to show it cares about education standards in Ireland and those who provide it, explained one teacher on strike, pleading with the government to show the education sector the respect it deserves. A government spokesman did respond when we put the concerns to them earlier today. We. Care. I thought that was pretty obvious. Have you not being paying attention to our policies for the last few years at all? the spokesman responded. Having said that teachers are the rock bed of the foundation of the first steps of a life, blah, blah, blah, the spokesman added. The government refused to comment on ongoing funding concerns with several IT colleges, or lengthy waiting lists for third level students wishing to access counselling services. Some 99% of the country was backing the bid to be paid for supervision work until they learned it may require an increase in their taxes in order to fund it.|2022-09-30 23:00:00|FAKE|Aria Shah|Capital Gazette|870602|58667|443|4728|Vietnam|English|2022-09-04 13:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2563200|280800|1844|7.383333333333334

All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News, voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago, I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th.|2022-10-01 10:00:00|FAKE|Nora Patel|Daily Digest|200201|4839|143|7111|South Korea|English|2022-09-09 05:00:00|Editorial|1|True|2602800|684000|1103|2.3833333333333333

I can remember the moment as if it happened only an hour ago. I was young, having just been asked to leave the seminary after I repeatedly refused to chip in for Wi-Fi, and walking through downtown Kansas City when I came across this sirloin steak. Never before had I seen something so special. I took the meat up into my hands and eyed it for a solid three minutes before I set it back down on a manhole cover and continued on my way. A chance meeting, sure. But an unforgettable one. 3. seen and held raw meat, as well! This pork chop, while raw, is still deserving of human touch, and I provided that comfort for it. Anyone would have done the same. 4. When you win a one-day, two-nights cruise to Stamford, CT on a radio call in sweepstakes, you think you have it made. But I was a bit nervous when I took this succulent rack of St. Louis ribs onboard with me. It was my very first cruise, and I know what to expect. But just say I was extremely happy that I won two tickets for this maiden voyage. 5. currently holding this tenderloin in my hands, but sadly, I have not opened my eyes to gaze upon it yet. The time will come, though, when I see it. And it will be incredible. 6. another cut of meat that has sensed my touch and stare. This one I was holding and touching in a helicopter a few years back. It was the helicopter of my rival, and he was trying to show me how much better his life was than mine. All I had was the meat, a far cry from a fully functional helicopter. So even though he asked me not to bring meat onto his helicopter, I insisted. It made me feel less small.

Conventional lead-acid batteries use two lead plates, submerged in a solution of sulfuric acid and water. The sulfuric acid is highly toxic and can burn and damage the environment if the battery leaks. These batteries use a solution of salt water instead of acid and the results are astounding. As opposed to lead-acid batteries, which can only be discharged to about 50% of their capacity, these salt water batteries can be discharged to 90%, meaning they can utilized 40% more of their energy per charge. Each battery can handle 3,000 discharges, meaning they can last 3,000 days and nights. They are also stackable, useful for increasing your power needs. Another awesome feature is that these batteries catch on fire like lead-acid batteries. If interested in purchasing one, you can, through website .

He just judges us on our looks. It is smart to take every opportunity to remind voters that as a human being, Donald Trump has consistently behaved in public like trash. He is a man who hates women and treats more than half of the population like objects. Having Machado introduce Clinton in Florida was also savvy politics. Trump has never demonstrated the personal restraint needed not to take the bait. comments should cause Trump to blow up again, and throw his dire campaign even further off message.

The occupation of the refuge ended with the death of rancher Robert LaVoy Finicum and the arrests of dozens of other protestors. Only much of what she said was a lie and interviewer Bobby Powell, Publisher of The Truth Is Viral news program, knew it. Eye-witness testimony from three separate individuals dispute account of events during the raid of a campground in Maryland during Operation American Spring by more than 40 agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, Maryland State Police, and the Secret Service. The witnesses all say Linnell was escorted away from the campground by the Secret Service while her friends and fellow campers were on their knees with automatic assault rifles pointed at their heads for hours. There is also evidence to indicate, including a slip of own tongue, that she has been an informant for the FBI, and possibly even a paid agent, since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2010.|2022-10-07 15:00:00|FAKE|Xavier Chang|Urban News|370108|51400|99|7765|Kenya|English|2022-10-01 01:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|2570400|3139200|1267|1.65

Local Afghan officials said more than two dozen civilians were also injured in the aerial assault which took place in the northern province of Kunduz on Thursday. Afghan forces and coalition troops conducted a joint operation against the Taliban insurgents. In the bombardment, 30 Afghan civilians were martyred and 25 others were wounded, media outlets quoted provincial spokesman, Mahmood Danish, as saying. Airstrike sparks anti-US protest rally Following the deadly airstrike, dozens of the relatives of those killed in the US-led raid staged a demonstration outside the office in Kunduz to condemn the attack as they were carrying the bodies of the victims. I am heartbroken. I have lost seven members of my family. I want to know, why these innocent children were killed? Were they Taliban? said Taza Gul, a 55-year-old laborer, adding, No, they were innocent children. Afghan government forces are engaged in fierce fighting against the militants in and around Kunduz.

They had briefly seized control of the city a year earlier but they were pushed out of Kunduz weeks later. They now seek to gain full control over the city. Taliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces. Afghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with Taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violence-wrecked country.

10143|Poll: 41 percent of voters say election could be ‘stolen’|"Email The Politico/Morning Consult Poll finds that 41 percent of voters think widespread voter fraud could cause the GOP nominee to lose the election. Amid Trump's increased warnings about a ""rigged election,"" 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be stolen from him, compared to 17 percent of Democrats. Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be ""rigged"" at many polling places. ""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary but also at many polling places SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters. Trump is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls following sexual assault and harassment allegations from multiple women. The Politico/Morning Consult poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points, 46 to 41 percent. In a RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton leads Trump by 5.5 points, 47.7 to 42.2 percent. While Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have tried to reassure the electorate about the reliability of the election system, the poll released Monday found 60 percent of Americans think it is necessary to question the accuracy of the election results. The poll was conducted among 1,999 registered voters Oct. and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points."|2022-10-08 17:00:00|FAKE|Jacob Gupta|Evening Echo|567597|45070|121|9532|Sudan|English|2022-09-24 22:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|2041200|3232800|1510|2.0166666666666666

10149|"Texas County Enacts ""Emergency Paper Ballots"" After ""Software Glitch"" In Voting Machines"|"Texas County Enacts ""Emergency Paper Ballots"" After ""Software Glitch"" In Voting Machines Oct 26, 2016 1:50 PM 0 SHARES Just yesterday we noted several social media complaints from Texas voters who alleged that when they voted a straight republican ticket that voting machines were switching their presidential selection to Clinton/Kaine. While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine ""irregularities"". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballots after a ""glitch"" was discovered in the county's voting machines. The issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. ES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. The Texas Secretary of State's office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. Below is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: Of course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a ""straight republican ticket."" The following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors ""had been happening."" This Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. Of course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this ""glitch"" was caught and how many other ""software glitches"" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?"|2022-10-10 19:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Capital Gazette|996511|37144|105|6073|Colombia|English|2022-09-12 23:00:00|Crítica|1|True|3412800|1008000|2442|1.75

Trump supporter charged in voter fraud case|Print According to CBS News , a Des Moines woman has been charged a woman with election misconduct, a Class D felony, after officials said she voted twice. Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek says officers charged 55-year-old Terri Rote with first-degree election misconduct on Thursday after being notified by elections officials that she had submitted two absentee ballots. The real bombshell comes in paragraph 3: According to an Iowa Public Radio report, Rote voted two times for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. After quoting oft-repeated line on the campaign trail: polls are rigged,' the CBS reporters note that development is not a one-off deal. They quote Polk County Attorney John Sarcone as saying, This [is] maybe the third [time] had some irregularity resulted in a criminal charge.

Most people think of Costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything. But the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason, and it could serve to tarnish their brand: The Blue Angels accidentally flew into the Costco in Augusta, GA and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer. Worst of all, it seem like Costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave. The Blue Angels were performing at a routine air show in Augusta, GA earlier today when they veered too close to the Costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer. Before Costco employees could react, the diamond formation of five F/A-18 Hornets had entered the store and began performing death-defying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbo-size ketchups. Customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead, but hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of Kirkland-brand dog food. usually a welcome treat to see the Blue Angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls, but inside Costco, the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance. So far all attempts to evict the Blue Angels have proved unsuccessful. At first, Costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket, assuming the Blue Angels would find their way back out eventually. After an hour, when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store, the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit. Unfortunately, that only caused the Blue Angels to accelerate to 700 mph and perform several loop-the-loops in the freezer aisle, where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating 8 Your heart just has to break for this poor manager. With the store set to close in only a few hours, Costco better think up a solution fast, or Blue Angels will be locked in overnight. If that happens, then customers will be aggravated by more of the same world-class aeronautic showmanship.

The Million Moms March was sponsored by Mothers for Justice United, an organization of mothers whose children have been killed by police officers and others, and the Coalition for Justice. The march moved from the U.S. Capitol to the U.S. Department of Justice, where demonstrators demanded changes in police practices. Maria Hamilton founded Mothers for Justice United and helped organize the march of mothers and their supporters. Hamilton's 31-year-old son, Dontre Hamilton, was shot 14 times and killed by a former Milwaukee police officer. ""This is a call for everybody to wake up,"" Hamilton said as the march began Saturday afternoon. ""We are here on behalf of our babies to tell the United States government that we aren't going anywhere. We aren't going to continue to keep burying our babies. Do something and do it now."" Hamilton said as moms walked through the streets they aimed to honor ""stolen lives"" in solidarity. ""We will continue to lift our babies up,"" she said. ""They live through each and every one of us. They are gone physically but we have our own personal angels now."" As demonstrators moved through the streets Saturday, some in the crowd shouted, ""No justice. No compromise,"" and ""Black lives matter."" Many of the mothers and other protesters held photos of young men and women killed by law enforcement officers. Others clutched bright yellow balloons, flowers and held hands. Mothers for Justice United, which also includes family members, clergy and concerned citizens, is focused on halting the killing of unarmed people of color by police and vigilantes through direct action, legislation and community building, the group says. Marion Gray-Hopkins, whose 19-year-old son Gary was killed by a police officer in Maryland in 1999, told NBC News she planned to participate. ""Enough is enough,"" Gray-Hopkins told the network. ""We need to put about some changes in laws and practices that will stop the senseless killing of our unarmed children."|2022-09-29 20:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|The Chronicle|120247|91170|448|4991|Mexico|English|2022-09-21 15:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|1756800|2466000|2132|7.466666666666667

Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) October 28, 2016 Wait, what? New emails tied to the FBI's Clinton inquiry were discovered during the investigation into Anthony Weiner's sexting Dude: Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, an aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner. In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they appear to be pertinent to the investigation. Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. was taking steps to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

10232|Silent Counter-Coup by 17 Intel Agencies To Stop Crooked Clintons [Video]|Leave a reply Bill Still Good evening, still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. According to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. Dr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community. He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. Currently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. I believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations. To me, hackers could not have done this. To me, white hats at NSA had to have been involved. Having spent my adult life working around the community, I knew that folks who were at most of these agencies exempting DHS and CIA are American patriots who would not allow this nation to be destroyed by the Clinton Crime Syndicate. [insert] This may well be the reason President Obama yesterday had his press secretary praise the work of Jim Comey, head of the FBI, at the very moment that Hillary Clinton was speaking in Florida deriding Comey. Let us all pray that Comey has actually turned away from being subservient to Obama and the Clintons and has now joined forces with the vast majority of the American military/intelligence community and Obama has decided for his own preservation to not fight them. still reporting from Washington; good evening.

He has written for USA Today, The Saturday Evening Post, the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, OMNI magazine, and has also produced the syndicated radio program, Health News.

Hillary LIES In First Press Conference While A LEAKED PHOTO From Her Airplane Reveals The Truth 0 comments Hillary is trying to present a strong front but the truth continues to emerge, in VIDEO and in PHOTOS! Hillary was traveling to Iowa when news broke of the newly-reopened investigation of her email practices. Her plane sat on the tarmac for thirty minutes before she emerged, and, of course, the media was hungry for a statement. Last night, the press got their wish, as Hillary tried to appear strong in her first press conference following the bombshell news. Watch statement below: Mostly, Hillary is echoing her Campaign Manager, John Podesta, who is calling for the release of more information from the FBI. Right out of the gate, Hillary is already lying in an attempt to minimize the damage that this new investigation is causing. She clearly states in the video above that the FBI sent the investigation announcement to Republicans in Congress. As a former Senator, Hillary knows this to be untrue, and she is trying to paint the issue as a partisan attack. Fact check: Contrary to what Clinton said, Comey sent letter to both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. @benyc ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 28, 2016 Multiple media sources have reported that the FBI found new information while investigating the sexting scandal of former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner is married to top aide, Huma Abedin. When asked about the reports, Hillary responded: You know, heard these rumors. We know what to believe and sure there will be even more rumors why incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what talking about because, right now, your guess is as good as mine and I think good enough. Hillary is trying to appear defiant and in control. But, speaking of Huma Abedin, take a look at this leaked photo from inside of airplane after the news had broken: Image surfaces of Huma Abedin crying on plane as Clinton Campaign finds out the FBI has re-opened the email investigation. #HillarysEmails  We hate to see a lady crying, Huma, but when the company you keep includes Anthony Weiner, sometimes you have good reasons to cry. Perhaps Campaign is not so strong after all.

According to reports, the two had boarded the plane when they started chanting Allah repeatedly. When a flight attendant noticed what they were doing he sprang into action and stopped them dead in their tracks. The couple has since taken issue with Delta, claiming that they had been which is tough to do considering Islam is not a race but rather a religion. The couple in question, Faisal and Nazia Ali, claim to be victims of religious discrimination after they had to be removed for suspicious activity on an airplane. Most people would probably find being the only two people on the plane that were hiding their phones as the steward passes, sweating, and repeating the word Allah on an international flight to the united states from Paris a little suspicious. exactly the type of behavior that this couple was exhibiting when the flight attendant had to take action and do so quickly, reports The Independent. After the flight attendant noticed this odd behavior he chose to act, taking the safety of the passengers and the crew above any sort of reprimand he might receive for being a or a bigot. He told them to get up grab their things and get off of the plane. when one of the Delta employees said that the pilot had made the final call because their behavior had made the rest of the passengers feel uncomfortable. The couple then went through an interrogation process before they were determined to not be a threat and sent home on the next flight and then offered a full refund. Of course this enough for this entitled couple. The couple took this so-called and contacted the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which by the way has ties to terror organizations.

1026|Clinton, under fire for oil and gas donations, once hit Obama for same reason|"Clinton lost her temper at an event on Thursday when activists from Greenpeace and 350 Action, two environmental organization, asked her to ""reject fossil fuel money"" and not accept donations from the gas and oil industry. ""I'm so sick of the Sanders' campaign lying about me. I'm sick of it,"" Clinton said. In response to the confrontation, Nick Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, said the candidate ""has not taken a dollar from oil and gas industry PACs or corporations."" Clinton's campaign, in fact, has not received any money directly from oil and gas companies, as that would violate election law. ""You've seen the ad,"" says a narrator before cutting to a separate ad of Obama saying, ""I don't take one from oil companies."" ""No candidate does. It has been against the law for 100 years,"" says the narrator. ""But Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies. Every gallon of gas takes over three bucks from your pocket. But Obama voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill that puts $6 billion in the pocket of big oil."" The narrator adds, ""Hillary voted against it. She will make oil companies pay to crate the new jobs in clean energy America needs."" Clinton concludes the ad by saying, ""I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message."" The ad ran during Pennsylvania's primary, a state Clinton won by nearly 10 percentage points. Clinton's ad was a response to Obama's own ad that said, ""I'm Barack Obama. I don't take money from oil companies or Washington lobbyists and I won't let them block change anymore."" Both Clinton and Obama accepted money from executives and employees of oil companies during the 2008 campaign, according to Center for Responsive Politics . Obama accepted $222,309 and Clinton accepted $309,363, according to the watchdog. Clinton's 2016 campaign has taken more than $300,000 from people who work for those companies, according to Greenpeace. Clinton's campaign noted on Thursday that Sanders has taken upwards of $50,000 from the same individuals. Brian Fallon, Clinton's press secretary, responded to the 2008 ad by noting that Sanders, too, has taken money from employees at oil and gas companies. ""Then, as now, both Democratic candidates in the race accepted donations from employees of oil and gas companies,"" Fallon said. ""We have not accused Senator Sanders of being beholden to the oil and gas industry on that basis, nor should he say that of Hillary Clinton."|2022-09-05 06:00:00|REAL|Nora Patel|Daily Digest|685345|95563|345|4965|Spain|English|2022-09-02 21:00:00|Reportaje especial|0|True|342000|136800|2427|5.75

Its denizens are quite fatalistic about it, and their only means of protection is leaving their door open for the night, as they can never be sure if they can open it in the morning.

10266|Standing Rock Protests: Police Turn In Badges Rather Than Incite Violence|Share on Facebook It should be evident if following news concerning the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota that tension continues to escalate between protestors supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and riot police. The big deal? A four-state Dakota Access Pipeline which threatens to uproot sacred burial ground, poison the Missouri river, and make null an 1881 treaty ensuring the property belongs to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. In addition to being maced and beaten with batons, activists have been tased and even shot with rubber bullets . Despite the violence taking place, tribal leaders continue to ask all water protectors to maintain peaceful relations and rely on prayer as the only weapon used to halt construction of the DAPL. After watching videos of the mass arrests and beating that have taken place , many have asked how those employed by the State can continue to terrorize weaponless protestors. Surely, some form of cognitive dissonance must be taking place? For some, most likely, and that's undoubtedly what inspired at least two officers to turn in their badges today. According to an activist named Redhawk, there have been reports of at least two officers turning in their badges after acknowledging that the battle against the American people is not what they signed up for. On Facebook, the activist wrote : You can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions. We must keep reminding them they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against this pipeline as well. The comments on the ordeal have been quite positive. Charlotte Holywater Vincent wrote, Brave to stand up for what is right ! To hand over years of training and service in a little metal badge and then stand on the side of humanity. Ron Hemming, who reportedly is a retired deputy in Washington, shared his thoughts: As a retired deputy in Washington state, I would have refused to go on a detail such as this. As I am also part native blood, I stand with my relatives on the front line protecting the water from the black snake. Be safe, stay strong.

10268|Is Obama preparing a parting shot on Israel? This President must not bind the next|Print Last week, the premier cultural agency, UNESCO, approved a resolution viciously condemning Israel (referred to as the Occupying Power) for various alleged trespasses and violations of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Except that the resolution never uses that term for holiest shrine. It refers to and treats it as an exclusively Muslim site, a deliberate attempt to eradicate its connection let alone its centrality to the Jewish people and Jewish history. This Orwellian absurdity is an insult not just to Judaism but to Christianity. It makes a mockery of the Gospels, which chronicle the story of a Galilean Jew whose life and ministry unfolded throughout the Holy Land, most especially in Jerusalem and the Temple. If this is nothing but a Muslim site, what happens to the very foundation of Christianity, which occurred 600 years before Islam even came into being? This UNESCO resolution is merely the surreal extreme of the worldwide campaign to delegitimize Israel. It features the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), now growing on Western university campuses and some mainline Protestant churches. And it extends even into some precincts of the Democratic Party.|2022-10-11 06:00:00|FAKE|Sophie Chen|Newsline|716036|65484|78|7215|Thailand|English|2022-09-28 07:00:00|Crítica|0|True|2332800|3452400|1190|1.3
1027|Ben Carson Throws Support Behind Donald Trump|"Retired nuerosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson has formally endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president. Carson, who dropped out of the race last week, made the announcement alongside Trump at Mar-a-Largo on Friday, the billionaire's luxury club in Palm Beach. ""I have found that, in talking with him, that there's a lot more alignment philosophically and spiritually than I ever thought there was,"" Carson said during a press conference announcing his endorsement. ""It's about 'we the people.' We need to empower the people,"" Carson said in response to a question about his decision. ""That is not going to be done through politics as usual, be that Republican politics as usual, or be that Democrat politics as usual."" ""It requires somebody who's a bit of an iconoclast but someone who has the ability to listen and to make wise decisions,"" Carson said at the news conference, referring to why he endorsed Trump. During Thursday night's GOP presidential debate, Trump confirmed the two spent time together earlier Thursday and discussed education and how to improve schools. Citing sources close to Carson, the Washington Post reported he and Trump met in Palm Beach, earlier Thursday and reached an agreement. ""I hope that we can bridge the gap with everybody,"" Carson said. ""All the policies that I have ever talked about -- and Mr. Trump is going to be on board with this, too -- we talk about things that are good for everybody, not for this group or that group."" ""We will be looking at ways to do things that benefit all Americans that create an equal playing field -- equality of opportunity -- that's what we're looking for,"" he continued. One source said Carson had been torn between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, but opted to support Trump because of a rumor circulated ahead of the Iowa caucuses by the Cruz campaign that Carson had dropped out of the race. In an interview with Fox News Radio's ""John Gibson Show"" Thursday, Carson was asked whether he was planning to join the Trump campaign. ""Let's put it this way, I'm certainly leaning,"" he said earlier, adding that there are ""two Donald Trumps"" - the one seen on television and the one he's gotten to know behind the scenes."|2022-09-26 06:00:00|REAL|William Kumar|The Daily Dispatch|578104|57759|326|9067|Philippines|English|2022-09-09 05:00:00|Crítica|0|True|2156400|684000|2229|5.433333333333334

It goes into the character of the candidates, and their fitness for office. In GOP nominee Donald Trump, we have an unstable reality star who is dangerously unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and nothing more than a bigoted demagogue who has managed to fleece half the nation into believing his authoritarian ways will solve all their problems. On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton taking up the mantle for the Democrats. She will take the nation forward into a brighter future, reassure and protect our allies, and continue the social and economic progress that President Obama has done so much for. talking about a woman who has been First Lady, a United States Senator, and Secretary of State. She performed admirably in all of those roles. And now, at the end of what has been a bruising, ugly campaign thanks to the dangerous rhetoric of one Donald J. Trump, we have forgotten one thing: We are witnessing history. Hillary is the first woman to shatter the glass ceiling to become the nominee of one of two major parties. easy to lose sight of all of that in such a crazy election season, but we have much to celebrate. Luckily, campaign lose sight of that, and they released an amazingly inspiring video that chronicled her meteoric rise to the Democratic nomination for President. It goes from the announcement, through the primaries, and through the ridiculousness of having to run against Donald Trump.

10287|Police Department Is Being Evicted – Lafayette, CA|An East Bay police department is now looking for a new office after being kicked out by their landlord. The Lafayette Police Department is being evicted from Desco Plaza because there are not enough parking spots for all of their police cruisers. According to city manager Steven Falk, the overbearing presence of cruisers is impacting tenants in the building, affecting their ability to park their own vehicles. Desco Plaza owner Curt Blomstrand has told the department that it must leave as soon as its lease ends at the end of the year. In a council meeting earlier this week Blomstrand referenced a growing force and too many police cars crammed into his property as reasons for evicting the department. Each tenant gets ten parking spaces, but the department is using forty.

10289|Thousands of Wild American Bison Appear From No Where At Standing Rock|Something incredible happened at the front-line of Standing Rock in North Dakota today. The brave men and women, who are protecting water and attempting to stop the Dakota Access pipeline from being built on treaty land, just received assistance from a large herd of wild buffalo that seemed to appear out of nowhere! Thousands of people are sacrificing their livelihoods and safety for a much greater cause by being there. Seeing those wild buffalo meant so much because in traditional Native culture the Tatanka Oyate (American Bison) is a sacred symbol. The bison always gave their lives to provide food, shelter, and clothing through the use of their meat and their hides. Ceremonies were always conducted to honor their sacrifice and many blessings they provided. being reported that Tatanka Oyate were prayed to and called upon for support and by the people at Sioux. While the sweeping arrests, pepper sprays, violence with batons and shots of rubber bullets was happening, a huge eruption of uplifting cheers, excitement and laughter could be heard when the Bison were spotted by the people. This was such a spectacular sight to behold. The peaceful path of affirmative non-violent civil disobedience being adequately responded to by higher level governmental authorizes. The whole world is watching. Sioux tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and stop the exploitation of the indigenous communities and the entire planet. The bison represents abundance of the bounty and respect for all creation knowing that all things are sacred. The bison also represented their spirit and reminded them of how their lives were once lived, free and in harmony with nature. It should remain that way Sources: Photo Credit: USuncut.com |2022-09-28 13:00:00|FAKE|Lily Wang|Daily Beacon|371168|92778|232|517|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-21 12:00:00|Crítica|1|True|1746000|2354400|1809|3.8666666666666667

10297|Dr. Mercola: The Dangers of LED Lights|Leave a reply Alexandra Bruce Dr. Joseph Mercola interviews Dr. Alexander Wunsch about the hidden dangers of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. Our eyes were designed to receive the light frequency of the Sun. Rays strike the optic nerve, which signals the pituitary gland, triggering the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate our bodily functions. The mitochondria of each cell in the human body produce almost entire bodyweight in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per day (!) and the human body can only live for 15 seconds without it, as compared to 4-10 minutes without air, 3-4 days without water. Another shocking thing we learn is that we only receive 1/3rd of what is converted into ATP from the food we eat. The overwhelming percentage of our ATP production comes from the light we receive through our eyes and skin. With many of us staring at screen devices or spending most of our time indoors with energy-saving LED lighting, few of us are aware of the adverse effects that LEDs have on retinal health, hormonal health and mental health, because these do not emit the correct frequency of light, in order for us to produce ATP. Dr. Mercola calls his conversation with Dr. Wunsch One he most important interviews you will ever see.

10299|Fact Check: Democrats Have Created Twice As Many Jobs As Republicans Since 1950’s|Comments Democrats are better for the economy. This statement is not an opinion, but a fact. According to economist Steven Stoft, who created a series of graphs charting job creation under each party over the last 72 years (during which time Democrats and Republicans have held control for 36 years each), Democrats have created 58 million jobs while Republicans can only claim 26 million . For roughly the last century, electing a Democrat has been the better option for the economy, with Dems creating more than double the jobs than that of Republicans, and faster. Even when taking the percent change of number of jobs held, or scaling population (to avoid counting an increased population, thus falsely indicating an increase in jobs), Democrats still prove more successful than Republicans in job creation, and by a wide margin. Another way of studying job creation is to take unemployment into account. When a Democrat is in the White House, logically unemployment decreases as well. By this rational, of course, when a GOP takes the Oval Office unemployment rises (and has risen under this party) since 1945. Indeed, this extends to state and federal top 20 years of national GDP growth have all been under a Democrat. This is not only true for GDP, but for all economic growth in to the stock market, income growth and debt as a percentage of GDP. As if you needed more proof that the blue party is better for the economy, simply turn to the numbers over the last 70 years. When it comes time for Election Day, a matter of fact that with every Democratic ballot cast, almost guaranteed the country will be in a better economic position than if a Republican is sworn in.|2022-09-06 12:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Frontline Times|235003|89600|167|3255|Tanzania|English|2022-09-01 14:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|450000|25200|1677|2.783333333333333
103|Starbucks baristas stop writing 'Race Together' on cups|"In a marketing fiasco that could rank right up there with New Coke, Starbucks has ditched its plan to have baristas ignite a national discussion on race after critics advised the chain its view of black and white should revolve around coffee and milk. The baristas had begun writing ""Race Together"" on customers' cups, as a means of starting a conversation with customers, but the practice ended Sunday after just one week, said company spokesman Jim Olson. But the chain's initiative will continue more broadly without the handwritten messages, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said. The cups were always ""just the catalyst"" for a larger conversation and Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA Today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, according to a company memo from CEO Howard Schultz said. The campaign has been criticized as opportunistic and inappropriate, coming in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks. The critics blasted Corey duBrowa, the company's senior vice president of global communications, on Twitter after the plan was first announced, calling it patronizing at best and inflammatory at worst. The executive was forced to delete his Twitter account, although he re-activated it the next day. Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity, he tweeted. I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted. The phase-out is not a reaction to that pushback, Olson said. ""Nothing is changing. It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned."" He echoed the company memo, saying of the Race Together initiative, ""We're leaning into it hard."" Schultz's note acknowledged the skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach. ""While there has been criticism of the initiative -- and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise,"" it read. He said the campaign at its core aims to make sure that ""the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few.""

Via AntiMedia Putin accused Western nations of having mythical, dreamt-up problems, and insisted the idea that Russia was going to attack the West was simply stupid and unrealistic. He added that he believes the idea is being played up to justify bigger military spending. The Russian president also sought to dismiss allegations that he is plotting to rig the US elections to his own benefit, noting that the US is a great power and not some banana republic with an easily manipulated political system. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots. NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time. Such predictions started after the ouster of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine led to a civil war in that east, with NATO military leaders repeatedly predicting Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine into NATO countries.|2022-09-22 11:00:00|FAKE|Olivia Kumar|Daily Digest|163981|59997|340|9365|Italy|English|2022-09-14 08:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1126800|1828800|1229|5.666666666666667

In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. Our our commitment to building vehicles in America, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio. The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We decided what will go there, said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States.

But it is not just that Jews want to destroy things for no reason. But this is, especially among the American Jewish elite, a vendetta against Vladimir Putin. This vendetta was described by American preeminent Russia scholar, Professor Stephen F. Cohen. To be sure, Cohen did not say in so many words that this was a Jewish vendetta. But he also did not call it a globalist or corporate or reptilian Nazi vendetta, which are just ways of distracting attention away from the Jewish role. He blamed a war party which he described as led by the (((New York Times))), the (((Washington Post))), and officials in the Defense and State Department like (((Victoria Nuland))). Connect the dots for yourselves, goys. He does not say why this war party, as he calls it, wants to regime change Putin. But a look at recent Russian history, a history that he has written so much about, makes it clear. After the Soviet Union was dismantled in what was basically an unconstitutional coup carried out by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a time when Russia was just one (although by far the largest) of the 15 Soviet republics that made up the Soviet Union, he proceeded to privatize state assets as part of a shock therapy program pushed by Harvard Professor (((Jeffrey Sachs))), who was brought in as an advisor by Privatization Minister (((Anatoly Chubais))).

But despite their sadness, they can take comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on. His sister Karen has taken over his Facebook page and honors her brother by continuing to share Islamophobic rhetoric in his memory. Absolutely beautiful. They rarely chose to talk about politics while he was alive, but Karen has been able to reconnect with her brother since his death by discovering his fear and hatred of Islam. been a steep learning curve, but in time been able to understand so much about what he cared about most, and she now feels closer to him than ever. The threat Syrian refugees pose to our freedom, the politicians who willingly turn a blind eye to the rising threat of Islamic of the bigoted beliefs that made Robert who he was. Since picking up the mantle of his Facebook account, Karen has committed to maintaining the xenophobia that exemplified her life. When Time magazine ran a story about a Muslim woman who felt unsafe in America, Karen understood right away that Robert would want to share the article with the comment Maybe feel more safe if she moved to Saudia Arabia where she can practice Sharia Law with the rest of them. Sometimes a sister just knows. For those who were close to Robert, seeing a backwards, misinformed post decrying the spread of radical Islam is like being with him again. His page is a place where those who knew him can come share a memory and talk about the spread of Sharia what Robert would have wanted. Whenever she posts about the inherent violence in the Muslim faith, Karen takes comfort in knowing that with every like and share, her brother remains a vibrant part of lives. In the wake of death, I think everyone was just looking for a place to see hateful rhetoric, says Karen, who remembers her brother by spending two to three hours per day scouring the internet for signs of a larger Islamic conspiracy. I miss him every day. But as long as I continue to invite his Facebook friends to like a group whose mission is to block the construction of mosques in America, like still here. Wow, if only everyone had such a devoted sister! Wherever he is, Robert must be resting easy knowing his sister is there to share his hateful, paranoid beliefs with the world.|2022-09-25 02:00:00|FAKE|Jacob Gupta|Voice of the Nation|375513|4480|425|1346|India|English|2022-09-11 08:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|867600|2055600|2346|7.083333333333333

And the list goes 24:21; Hebrews 4:13) Now Hillary and the foreign agent in the White House, Barack Hussein Obama, are being exposed for voter rigging . Obama has been visited 45 times out of his 340 visits to the White House by election rigging guru and former prison inmate Robert Creamer . The new scapegoat for Obama and Clinton is Russia. They are now being blamed for the crime when it is Clinton and Obama who are literally exposed in their own corruptions. America, do not be diverted from these diplomatic magicians from hell (John 8:44-45). The Clintons have been selling uranium ore to the Russians . This is now World Wrestling Entertainment on a global scale, as they continue to play off of each other. They are not archenemies. They are allied in crime together, period. Furthermore, like that of the Bushes, China, Russia and America, as well as the Pope, they are all calling for the new world. They are allied with the covenant of Hell, which I remind you disannulled (Isaiah 28:15-18). Many are wondering why Hillary Clinton is even up on the platform during debates. It comes to this, the American people have been soft on these corrupt criminals, and have been soft on themselves. However, God will not be soft (Nahum 1:3), and these corrupt individuals have been encouraged to act out in a more corrupt manner. Americans have also allowed the appeasers that identify themselves as prosecutors and government oversight to talk big . Yet, they produce nothing when it comes to justice (Amos 5:7). They are the fox in the chicken coop, acting as if they actually mean what they say. They are protecting themselves as much as the establishment in which they are a part. Then there are those who pose as some sort of patriotic representatives when, in fact, they are the same people that have given Barack a pass every step of the way. These are a few of those who are the establishment: Colin Powell|2022-10-07 14:00:00|FAKE|Gabriel Santos|The Reporter|56290|87039|303|5872|Kenya|English|2022-09-07 03:00:00|Opinión del lector|1|True|3135600|504000|1994|5.05

The only problem is that it was a Donald Trump supporter who committed voter fraud by voting twice. Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into jail Thursday on a felony charge of first-degree election misconduct after being arrested for suspicion of voting twice, according to the Des Moines Register . Authorities say the registered Republican cast two electoral ballots in Polk County. She was held in jail on a $5,000 bond and released Friday.

10378|Re: DePaul: “Unborn Lives Matter” Posters Are Veiled Bigotry|Print There are times that we are guilty of doing things that are offensive and we are unaware. Not knowing the culture you offend puts you in a position to seem bigoted. But are you responsible for how others perceive your words? Are you accountable to ensure that no one is ever offended by your words and actions? Is that even possible? It seems that this is now what is expected of DePaul University students. They are only to express themselves in ways that others will not take offense. The Washington Times reports : The largest Catholic university told a group of pro-life students that it could not display posters reading Unborn Lives Matter, lest they provoke the Black Lives Matter movement. In a letter to the College Republicans, DePaul University president Father Dennis Holtschneider said the posters contained bigotry veiled under the cover of free speech, the Daily Wire reported. By our nature, we are committed to developing arguments and exploring important issues that can be steeped in controversy and, oftentimes, emotion, Mr. Holtschneider said in the letter. Yet there will be times when some forms of speech challenge our grounding in Catholic and Vincentian values. When that happens, you will see us refuse to allow members of our community be subjected to bigotry that occurs under the cover of free speech. So to twist the popular slogan of one group to fit another group is bigoted? Would they feel this way if the sign were different? What if the sign read, Black Unborn Lives Matter, would that be bigoted? The truth is, the university is beginning to crack down on freedom of speech and expression, if those thoughts and expressions are conservative. More mind control from the left.

The UKIP interim leader had flown back into the country after spending much of the weekend cosying up to fellow man of the people, President-elect Donald Trump, in a Manhattan penthouse apartment painted gold. Simon Williams, Home Office spokesman, said, Our sniffer dogs are trained to smell even the tiniest remnants of illicit substances on clothing and suitcases. However, they were not needed this time as fellow passengers and staff were all able to notice this foul stench wafting through the cabin since the flight took off in New York. On inspection, Mr nose was found to be thickly cased in a brown substance, which we are treating as a biological hazard. Further traces were found on his tongue, and sent it off for further testing. A UKIP spokesman said, In the human centipede that is diplomatic relations with the US, Nigel has valiantly shown his willingness to get on all fours and bury his face deep inside Mr rectum for the good of Queen and country. The country needs the intimate knowledge Nigel possesses of this man, and we await a call from Number 10 wanting his expertise. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

10386|Israeli Minister sparks Scandal after showing Satisfaction for Italy's Earthquakes|Two earthquakes, which struck Italy this week, were retribution for the support of the UNESCO resolution disregarding the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, Israeli Deputy Minister for Regional Cooperation Ayoob Kara said. sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision, Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported. Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. According to Kara, Pope Francis strongly disagreed with the resolution. He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel, the deputy minister stressed. As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe.

The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of email practices.

Huma Abedin has worked as Hillary top assistant for years. You are likely familiar with Huma, as she is a regular on the campaign trail with Hillary, and has also been in the news for years as the wife of Anthony Weiner, the embattled former Congressman who is perpetually accused of sexting improprieties. Reportedly, the FBI is reopening its investigation of private email practices after finding evidence of involvement on one of Anthony electronic devices. It is a small world, it? Another Clinton employee, a name that you may not be familiar with, is popping up in the news lately for reasons that are startling, to say the least. Justin Cooper is an Information Technology worker who is reported to have set up private email server. Recently, he even testified before a House Committee, saying that he extracted information from Clinton-related smart devices before smashing them to bits. It is said that testimony is the most informative we have heard yet. Judge Andrew Napolitano has expressed concern over access to this information, among other things, as Cooper did not hold a Security Clearance. He was an employee of the Clinton family and of the Clinton Foundation, and he had complete and total access to the Clinton emails, and he had no security clearance, Judge Napolitano explained on Varney & Co. today. Unfortunately, for Hillary and Huma, new, leaked information has come to light, and it has Justin name all over it: Justin Cooper was the Clinton aide who set up the email server.Huma: ""My clinton [black]berry not working""Cooper: ""We were attacked again""  Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) October 28, 2016 You read that correctly Huma: My clinton [black]berry not working Cooper: We were attacked again So Huma and the Clinton Staff knew all along that they were being attacked, also known as hacked!

Bernie Sanders laid out the ways he would leverage his popularity that emerged from the Democratic primary to continue to push Hillary Clinton to the left if she wins the presidency next month. In an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is more progressive than its presidential nominee. He emphasized that he saw it as his role to demand that the Democratic Party implement the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be vigorously in opposition if Clinton attempted to abandon the progressive elements. The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people, Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22. That gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use, he added.

Be Sociable, Share! Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret explosive evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming everyone knows that they are true, and appears unsettled by the refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that stop Clinton from calling Trump a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. With main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that be happening.

10430|NASA Admits: Someone Took Control Over Space Probe Voyager 2 And Sent Data In An Unknown Language|NASA have revealed that a curious incident in 2010 might be firm evidence that an alien species is attempting to create communication links with humanity. In 2010, Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft powered by human beings to leave the known solar system. According to NASA expert Kevin Baines, at the time that the craft entered interstellar space, it became to send communications to the base on Earth in a language that was totally incomprehensible to the scientists who received it. NASA spacecraft hijacked by aliens? Baines said that the team immediately assumed that the spacecraft was malfunctioning in some way and proceeded to run a full assessment of its systems. However, they could find nothing wrong with it except that one component in the binary code system had been changed from 0 to 1. After running further investigations, they were left with no alternate explanation except that someone or something had taken temporary control of the spacecraft . The minute change in the binary code suggested that someone or something deliberately tried to alter aspects of Voyager computer system. This suggested to the team on the ground that the spacecraft had been temporarily taken over by computer hackers. However, they think it was likely that the hackers were of terrestrial origin as they would not have been able to make contact with the spacecraft at such an enormous distance. WATCH THE VIDEO: It took the experts at NASA three weeks to be able to reassert control over the computer system and correct the era. Officially, NASA has conceded that they have absolutely no idea about who or what could have taken temporary control over Voyager 2 and sent the incomprehensible message to their team on the ground. However, German scientist Hartwig Hausdorff has not been so coy in revealing what he thinks was behind the incident he is confident that the message was sent by an alien species.

I had an uncle (by marriage) who was Italian. In 1940 he was still not a US citizen, although I gather he had begun the process, so he was sent to an internment camp in Wyoming (or Montana?). While he waited for his citizenship application to be completed, he and his fellow detainees played a lot of poker. His papers were finally processed, he was made a US Citizen, then was promptly drafted into the US Army as a Sargent (Supply).

10475|Florida Republicans Voting for Hillary Clinton · Guardian Liberty Voice|On November 1, 2016, early voting polls in Florida indicate more than one-quarter of registered Republicans have cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton. Two states that the Democratic presidential nominee must win are North Carolina and Florida, which her campaign describes as checkmate states. She must carry the swing states to ensure the accumulation of electoral votes needed to be elected to the presidency. The CNN polls in October indicated that Clinton had an 18 point lead over Donald Trump among early voters. CBS reports the percentages of Republicans who cast early votes break down as follows; 11 percent registered since 2012, 83 percent voted in the last presidential election, and six percent did not vote four years ago. Among registered Democrats the numbers were similar. Early voting, in person or by mail, is underway in 37 states. Experts predict that more than 46 million people will have voted before next Tuesday, November 8. As of November 2, at 12:56 a.m. EDT, The New York Times daily prediction is that Clinton has an 88 percent chance over 12 percent to win. Hers are down 1 percent and his are up 1. from the day before. However, the paper indicates that the ROP candidate could win, although it is as unlikely as a professional football kicker missing a 35-yard field goal.

The machines are taking over The candidates in the current campaign or any campaign are all promising to bring back good jobs to create good jobs. When asked how they would do that, they are all a little light on details.About a year ago, Joe Biden was in Michigan to celebrate the opening of a new manufacturing plant that made small metal clamps used in all kinds of industries to hold wiring, hoses. Etc. in place. The largest market is the auto industry but they are sold to hundreds of other manufacturers. Depending on size, shape, and material, these parts sell for a few pennies or less. You have to make a lot of these parts to have any substantial billing numbers.This new plant is fully automated and runs 24/7/365 with just 14 people. Joe was quite happy saying manufacturing is returning to America.However, there is a backstory. That plant had been around for years. It had employed 600 people on two shifts. Then, the Chinese began to undercut the pricing, and the plant was no longer profitable and closed. Two years later, it reopened as a fully automated plant and regained the business because it could now manufacture cheaper than the Chinese.There are several stories inside the main story.The first story is about the initial plant closing. Anytime 600 people lose their jobs, you know that some employee ended up losing their home, that some cars were reprocessed, that some college kid had to quit school, etc. Retailers got hit. Utilities at the plant were no longer needed. Suppliers got hit too.More at [ My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance."" 09"|2022-10-09 01:00:00|FAKE|Isabella Nguyen|Newsflash|762470|71937|40|2992|Kenya|English|2022-09-16 02:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|1278000|3261600|1668|0.6666666666666666
10480|Police Officers Face Backlash After What They Did To Hillary In Photo|Share This A photo of Hillary Clinton with some police officers popped up on social media over the weekend, but people were divided in their reaction to it. The post on the Facebook page for the Medford Police Association caused controversy and backlash online over the content and what the was seen being done to crooked Hillary. The post showed Medford Police officers at the Fall Festival in Haines Square on Saturday. The photo was done in fun and captioned, Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square This image is an accurate depiction of what we all would like to see: Hillary in handcuffs. As you can plainly see, the photos show police officers with a woman in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed. It appears that they are arresting someone, who wore a mask in the likeness of Hillary Clinton. Screenshot from the Medford Police Facebook page In a second photo, the police officers posed with a person in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!! Screenshot from the Medford Police Facebook page Since a fair amount of overly sensitive pansies made a big deal about the posts, Harry MacGilvray, president of the Medford Police Association, decided to apologize for making the post. These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way, MacGilvray said in a statement. I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part. The posts have been removed to avoid hurting the feelings of overly-sensitive liberals. While most of us see the humor in these images and understand how insane it was to apologize for the posts that were clearly done in jest, liberals see things this way. They go out of their way, looking to be offended. If the police posed with a handcuffed Trump, pretty obvious that there would have been no outrage, because conservatives easily offended by free speech. However, a liberals sole purpose seems to be finding things to be offended over, and they have done it again.|2022-09-08 18:00:00|FAKE|Michael Sharma|The Observer|227594|11317|478|4523|Ukraine|English|2022-09-06 20:00:00|Artículo de investigación|0|True|644400|478800|2036|7.966666666666667
10484|Hillary Campaign Launching Attacks on the FBI|Hillary Campaign Launching Attacks on the FBI October If the Clinton campaign becomes any more deranged, Hillary will start running attack ads against the FBI. This kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad. Hillary presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the FBI on Sunday, circulating a draft letter critical of James Comey to former federal prosecutors. It is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees, the Clinton letter speaking for prosecutors said. The letter was signed and provided to The Daily Beast by Elkan Abramowitz, a former chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. It is expected to be released Sunday evening. So we have the bizarre spectacle of Hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the FBI, who was just being praised for clearing her, because when you're a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies, this is how you react. But it's also telling that the Clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the FBI.|2022-10-03 04:00:00|FAKE|Benjamin Singh|Morning Star|636305|49668|0|8430|Pakistan|English|2022-09-23 10:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1911600|2754000|1255|0.0

The former Washington diplomat rejected the idea that there are some moderate militants in Syria, declaring that they are all terrorists. People who for ideological or religious goals want to attack innocent people and kill them in order to impose some kind of an ideology on them, I think that constitutes terrorism, he said. And I think trying to overthrow a government of another country to achieve that purpose is terrorism, Jatras added. However Jihad Mouracadeh, a political analyst from Beirut, ruled out the accusation that the US and its allies want to redeploy Daesh from Mosul into Raqqah, according to regional reports. Recommended (3 months ago) Assange: Emails Prove Hillary Armed ISIS In Syria To Oust Assad Mouracadeh said the US and NATO are planning to attack the Syrian city; says so, it seems to be illogical to redeploy Daesh to a city that is going to be under attack. Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups.

10491|PressTV-‘Clintons worked with US enemies’|Interviews The FBI probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar, says American analyst Scott Bennett. The ongoing federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation was expected because of the Clinton ties with US enemies, says Scott Bennett, a former US Army psychological warfare officer. The FBI has been probing possible pay-to-play schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it, Fox News reported Wednesday, citing informed officials. Bennett told Press TV on Friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar, and many other countries blacklisted by Washington. It was revealed on Friday that the Clinton Foundation took a $1 million gift from Qatar during Hillary tenure as the US secretary of state, without her informing the State Department. Hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction, despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state. According to the website, Qatar has so far given the Clintons a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years. Aside from Qatar, Saudi Arabia has also been one of the Clinton biggest donors. It became known in 2008 that the kingdom had given them between $10 million and $25 million. So those terrorist entities, which have been labeled as the enemies of the United States, have been appearing as Clinton Foundation donors, Bennett said. That is a serious crime, it is treason, it is corruption, it is bribery of officials, said the analyst. Bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the Clinton family were coming from those personnel in the American government who have had enough. They have stepped up, they have released emails, they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to WikiLeaks, he added. Whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks has released thousands of campaign chairman and top aide John emails since last month, exposing some of the well-kept secrets surrounding the Clinton family and Hillary bid for the White House. Bennett predicted that the case would most probably lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend.

10492|TOP BRITISH GENERAL WARNS OF NUCLEAR WAR WITH RUSSIA; “THE END OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT”|Paul Joseph Watson Senior British army officer and former deputy supreme allied commander Europe Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff warns that NATO faces nuclear war with Russia in Europe, and that America is already technically at war with Russia. In a hawkish article for CNN , Shirreff asserts that the west faces the biggest threat from Russia since the Cold War and that Vladmir Putin plans to re-establish status as one of the great powers by marching into the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Comparing the policy towards Putin to the appeasement of Hitler, Shirreff claims that Moscow, may have already lit the fuse that could lead to the unthinkable: nuclear war with Russia in Europe. Under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, an attack on one NATO member country represents an attack on all member countries, meaning the United States would be at war with Russia if Russian troops set foot in Baltic countries. A Russian attack on the Baltic states puts America at war with Russia meaning nuclear war, because Russia integrates nuclear weapons into every aspect of its military doctrine, writes Shirreff. He also states that Russia is at war with America already, recycling the claim, which remains unproven, that Russia is behind the email hacks that led to publicizing of Clinton campaign emails. And think Russia would limit itself to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.

Ann Cameron, an author of many children's books, was devastated when she found out that she had ... Print Email Ann Cameron, an author of many children's books, was devastated when she found out that she had colon cancer. In June of 2012, she entered the third phase of her cancer. It was especially terrifying because her husband passed away from lung cancer in 2005 after receiving chemotherapy. She opted not to take the same path. I was exposed to operation for colon cancer in June 2012, and then I denied chemotherapy healing. I was feeling well, however after six months the cancer was spread to the lungs and entered the fourth phase,"" she said. She found a story about a man diagnosed with skin cancer who effectively cured it by consuming about two and a half kilograms of carrot juice every day. She thought it was worth a try and gave it a whirl. The results? Eight weeks later, her tumors had stopped spreading. Her tumor and lymph glands began to shrink.Four months later, her tissues were back to normal and her tumors were continuing their withdrawal.Eight months later, the registered tomograpy examination indicated the cancer was completely gone.It's something of a mystery why carrots did the trick. They're known to be rich in anticancer properties and contain carotene, which in some has been found to prevent tumors from growing. She wrote about her experiences in a book called Curing Cancer with Carrots .The takeaway? If you find yourself diagnosed with cancer, keep an open mind. What works for one may not work for everyone, but natural cures like this are worth pursuing.

10497|3 Charlotte Area Counties Report Voting Machines Picking Wrong Candidates|MecklenburgCatawba The complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a choice, but in all reported cases, the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them. To my knowledge, at this point, we have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints. Of course all looked into and why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official, commented Gannon. The NC State Board Of Election released the following statement regarding the complaints: The N.C. State Board of Elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touch-screen voting machines in several counties. Similar reports have been made in recent elections, and we take them very seriously. We want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touch-screen machines accurately record selections. Touch-screen machines are tested thoroughly before each election. They are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy. If a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine, they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately. If needed, the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration, and the voter may be moved to a different machine. Also, each touch-screen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot. As with paper ballots, voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot. On touch-screen machines, voters also can review a real-time audit log that records all of their selections. We urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots, and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials, said Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the N.C.

After a conservative anti-Trump SuperPAC ran a gross, slut-shaming ad which used a half-naked photograph of Trump's wife Melania, Trump threatened to ""spill the beans"" on Cruz's wife, Heidi, presumably because he thought Cruz was behind the ad. (The SuperPAC is not affiliated with the Cruz campaign, though it is backing Cruz against Trump.) Trump then retweeted the below image, which compares a model shot of Melania with an unflattering photograph of Heidi. ""These images are worth a thousand words,"" reads the meme, implying that when it comes to the position of First Lady, all that matters is a woman's hotness. To Cruz's credit -- and I truly can't believe I'm giving a man who has compared abortion to slavery credit for anything that has to do with women -- Cruz didn't take Trump's bait. Instead he responded with this tweet: For Trump, and the GOP candidates writ large, the 2016 election has come down to a pathetic (and terrifying) rallying cry for traditional masculinity. There have been comments about hand size and comments about dick size and comments about Marco Rubio's ""high-heeled booties."" Trump has indirectly called Cruz a ""pussy"" and a ""soft, weak little baby,"" and said that Romney would have ""dropped to his knees"" for a 2012 endorsement. As The Guardian's Jessica Valenti put it, Trump and Cruz have officially ""gone full cavemen."" We are seeing the #MasculinitySoFragile hashtag play out in real time. As women -- or any group of people who aren't straight, white men -- continue to demand their voices be heard, and that policy change accordingly, we will see a backlash from those traditional arbiters of power. The 2016 GOP race has become their vicious last stand. note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims 1.6 billion members of an entire religion from entering the U.S."|2022-10-06 04:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|Metro News|635414|46898|183|54|Ukraine|English|2022-09-12 10:00:00|Opinión del lector|1|True|961200|3013200|2094|3.05
10505|Hillary Clinton Holds 6-Point Lead Despite FBI Probe [Update]|Despite the e-mail FBI probes currently ongoing, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton holds a 6-point lead over her rival Donald Trump. On October 31, 2016, at approximately 4:00 P.m. EDT, NBC announced, James Comey, FBI Director, released a statement about the Democratic nominee having several emails on a nonsecure server. The timing of the FBI probe, while Clinton holds a 6-point lead over Trump, remains coincidental. According to NBC: A recent poll tracking the election asked voters whether or not the release of letter was a publicity stunt to distract them or an attempt to address an actual problem. Due to the timing of the release, about 56 percent of voters believe the letter was to deter voters from voting for the Democratic nominee and remains unaffected. Voters have spoken out about the need for the FBI to probe Clinton, as she poses a threat to Trump as she holds a national 6-point lead. Update: CNN Politics A Poll conducted by CNN Politics shows that Clinton has a 5-point lead over North Carolina; a state Trump needs to win. Written By Jhayla D.

At a press conference earlier in the day, Mistry announced that he shall no longer be known as Cyrus Mistry, and instead asked everyone to call him Rohit Sharma-Mistry. Fifteen minutes after press conference, Ratan Rata called for a press conference and announced the decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Group. Mr. Sharma-Mistry is a rare talent who will be groomed for the future, said Tata. The Trustees and other directors of Tata Sons are convinced about Mr. ability and firmly believe that when he gets going, he can turn around any business within one quarter. Later, our correspondent reached out to the jubilant Sharma-Mistry and asked him what gave him this idea. Sharma-Mistry said that the emotional atyachar at Tata Sons was irking him, but then he met an inspired god man from Chennai, Cheeni Mama, who gave him guidance. Mr Sharma-Mistry is now considering building a temple for Cheeni Mama. After all, our organization is known for its charitable acts, and in TN it is accepted practice to build a temple for actors, so this is very well in line with our organizational ethos, Sharma-Mistry was quoted as saying.

10514|Texas Republican Calls Hillary The WORST Word You Could Ever Call A Woman, Blames Staffer (IMAGES)|With Hillary Clinton making history this election season by becoming the first women nominated by a major party, the sexism has been on full display. The misogynists on the Right have questioned her health, her stamina, and everything in between. That is, of course, code for the little woman belong in the Oval Office. However, one Texas Republican has taken the misogyny to a whole other level. Meet Sid Miller, the Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas. He is also a former lawmaker. Miller, like most Republicans, make his hatred for Hillary Clinton any secret. Instead, he somehow thought that it was perfectly appropriate to take to Twitter and express his feelings in a most disgusting way while tweeting about the polls. tweet reads: TRUMP 44 Cunt 43, punctuated with a cheering Go Trump Go! In the predictable firestorm after, Miller tried to make the public believe that his account was hacked. staff hastily relesed this defense of his post: The campaign was retweeting information today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term. The tweet was taken down as soon as possible. Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it. a problem with that, though: The tweet was not a retweet. It was simply a tweet. Therefore, either Sid Miller himself or someone on his staff wrote this: Naturally, Miller is Donald number one man in Texas, according to the Texas Tribune . No surprise there. Further, Miller is no stranger to making tasteless and offensive jokes with regards to Hillary. Here is one that is just a few hours old as of this writing: That tweet written in reference to the fact that the reason emails are in the news again is because of disgraced Congressman Anthony sexting scandals. So, in other words, this Sid Miller character is the perfect Donald Trump supporter a misogynistic and deeply ignorant asshat who stand the idea of losing to a woman.

10516|"Crushing Hillary: Trump’s Landslide by the Numbers | EndingFed News Network"|( New York Times Results by County) The media tell you this but Donald Trump CRUSHED Hillary Clinton in the recent election in three key areas: For one, the above results by county show that he picked up a significant amount of the counties in the US. The picture is clear that most counties in America voted for Trump . Secondly, the media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. HIllary turned in the Democratic worst Electoral College performance in 28 years. With only New Hampshire left to be called, Clinton has turned in the Democratic Party's worst Electoral College performance in 28 years  Dan O'Donnell (@DanODradio) November 9, 2016 Thirdly, in total states it was a landslide. Trump won 31 states to 19 states won by Hillary or 62% of the states. The mainstream will argue that Hillary beat Trump in the popular vote which appears accurate. According to the NYT she won 59,923,027 to 59,692,974 for a difference of only 230,053 or 0.4%. But in California and New York Hillary beat Trump by a combined 4 million votes. If not for these two huge liberal states, Hillary would have gotten shellacked in the popular voting as well. The mainstream media will not tell you but Trump won BIGLY!

In response to the letter sent by FBI Director James Convey to eight Republican committee chairman in Congress, Hillary for America Chair John Podesta released the following statement Friday: Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary presidential campaign. FBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen . Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is an investigation but words do not match that characterization. Director letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant. It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.

As soon as investigators can positively identify the suspect, which they are very sure they can they will go ahead and make a decision whether they want to arrest that suspect or seek a warrant. Fox411 spoke with a worker from Top End Construction who told them that the damage done to star was probably the worst I have seen. A man named Jamie Otis has taken responsibility for the destruction, according to Deadline Hollywood, which posted a video of the man taking a pickax to star. According to Deadline, Otis planned to auction off the star and give the money to the 11 women who have come forward with groping allegations against Trump just weeks before the presidential election. Trump has denied the groping allegations and painfully obvious that they are almost assuredly politically motivated . As far as what the women get out of it, some may be politically motivated themselves and others have had their ulterior motives money , fame, payback because Trump go to their restaurant, etc. exposed.

10543|NASA to test in flight folding wing|NASA to test in flight folding wing page: 1 link NASA is set to begin testing a new wing design that would change shape in flight, bending up or down, to increase yaw stability, reduce required rudder size, and decrease drag. The Boeing 777X is set to introduce wingtips that fold on the ground, to allow the aircraft to fit in existing gates with a longer wingspan. NASA is set to begin testing the Spanwise Adaptive Wing, which would add shape-memory alloy actuators to the wingtip area that would bend the tips up or down. The SMA actuators would activate when heated electrically, so there is no need for complex hydraulic lines or actuators. Beginning in Spring of 2017, NASA will start flying the Area-I PTERA UAV. It has a 176 inch wingspan, with the outer 15 inches moving as far as 75 degrees up or down. PTERA is not set up for SAW, but it appears that it could see a 40% rudder authority. The idea behind SAW is similar to what was done with the XB-70, with the wingtips angled down. Boeing will introduce folding wings to commercial aviation when the 777X airliner enters service at the end of 2019. But the devices could become commonplace on future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The 777X has almost 24 ft. more wingspan than 777 to optimize lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding the tips on the ground keeps the larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. But NASA is investigating whether also folding the wing in flight could save still more fuel. The Spanwise Adaptive Wing (SAW) concept will be tested on the ground and in flight in a rapid feasibility assessment under new Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The goal is to show that angling the outboard wing sections up or down can increase yaw stability and control, and reduce rudder size and tail drag.|2022-09-25 15:00:00|FAKE|William Kumar|The Daily Dispatch|53103|26323|459|6621|Turkey|English|2022-09-12 16:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|982800|2102400|1879|7.65
10545|Nuclear Reactor in Norway Leaks Radioactive Iodine|Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 One of nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] In a statement released today, the NRPA said: The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low. Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: Of course an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want. [2] The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. A senior NRPA official said the incident would maybe be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7.

Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: I sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it reported it good enough that we report it yesterday. [2] Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the frustration. We need to gather more information But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further. [3] The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

10547|VIDEO: Watch Newt Gingrich UNLOAD on Megyn Kelly Over Trump|Pinterest Newt Gingrich has accused Fox Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex, and not caring at all about public policy in a shocking and startling interview. The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed bias for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump. Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of sex, but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate. What set Gingrich off was mention of the leaked sex boasts tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals. Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. You are fascinated with sex and you care about public policy, he said. not fascinated by sex, but fascinated about sexual predators, Kelly said. The bias the media has against Trump especially focusing on sex is historic. This is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, Gingrich said.

""If you play with matches, you're going to start a fire you can't control,"" Clinton said about Trump at a caucus kick-off event at a local YMCA. ""That's not leadership. That's political arson. The test of leadership and citizenship is the opposite. If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. And if you see a bully, stand up to him."" Clinton acknowledged the ""anger"" that is motivating people on the left and the right of the political divide but said the way to bridge the gap ""is to stand together against the forces of division and discrimination that are trying to divide America between us and them."" Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, has made knocking Trump a regular part of her stump speech, blasting the businessman for comments he has made against Mexicans, women and Muslims. She regularly touts herself as the first candidate to call out his rhetoric. But at the outset of the Republican race, many inside Clinton's campaign saw Trump as an interesting sideshow, not someone who could credibly capture the Republican nomination. That has changed. Clinton's top aides now view Trump as the favorite to win the Republican nomination, and Clinton has started to go after the brash billionaire with more directness. ""You don't get the chance to make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great,"" Clinton said, parroting Trump's campaign slogan.

When pressed repeatedly by host Martha McCallum about why the campaign Photoshopped a picture of Rubio and Obama shaking hands in a picture on a website produced by the Cruz campaign, Tyler instead took aim at record. Marco Rubio and Barack Obama have shaken hands. There are plenty of photos of him shaking hands, he said. If they like the picture we picked, then send me a picture they like of Marco Rubio shaking hands with Barack Obama and swap it out. The website, which features other digitally altered images of the Florida senator, offers visitors the chance to take a stand against Rubio, with a link to Ted get-out-the-vote site.

1149|As Cruz Crushes Caucuses, GOP Establishment Needs a Drink And A Hug|Ted Cruz won more delegates than anyone else on Saturday night, further narrowing the race between Trump and Cruz, and weakening Marco Rubio as the race heads to Florida. Ted Cruz crushed the Kansas and Maine caucuses on Super Saturday while Donald Trump narrowly won the Louisiana and Kentucky prizes. But perhaps the biggest news was Marco Rubio fading in the field to a distant third place, despite racking up major endorsements across the map. Over the past six weeks, the GOP establishment has moved from denial to anger to bargaining in the stages of grief that have accompanied this outsider election. But with big fade, the Hail Mary of a brokered convention looks even less likely. And left of the center-right is heading for the next stage of depression. A hug and a drink are in order, as their party prepares to be wrested away from reform Republicans. The Florida to present himself as the establishment-friendly alternative to Donald perhaps his worst night yet, racking up zero wins, and failing to even snag a second-place finish anywhere. In fact, Rubio finished third in three of the four states contested on Saturday. And with just 8 percent, the Florida senator fell to fourth in to get the minimum 10 percent necessary to win any delegates. Marco has to get out of the race. Has to, Trump said. now no question that decision to descend to level of discourse has been a total failure. The attacks on the size of hands, the jokes about him wetting himself, the con artist name-calling, have all fallen flat. And the losses on Saturday could rob his campaign of desperately needed momentum. Rubio has repeatedly stated that he expects to win in his home state of Florida on March 15. And, of course, technically possible. But he has yet to lead in a single public poll of the state. And he want to talk about what do if Florida work out. The billionaire businessman, with the flair of a pro wrestler, said he hoped for a head-to-head match-up with Cruz. If Rubio takes advice, then some hot Cruz/Trump one-on-one action could be in our future.

1151|Bernie has already won the future of the Democratic Party|As the Democratic presidential contest reaches the third state, what began as a coronation is now an exciting dead heat. Yet by one measure, Bernie Sanders is a clear winner. Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party. Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama. Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession predict it often enough and eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect. A major piece of evidence is the enormous youth vote he attracts. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he beat Clinton by about 70 points 84 percent to 15 percent among voters under age 30. And despite the nasty demands by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem that women must support Clinton, Sanders got 82 percent of the young female vote. By contrast, Obama in the 2008 primaries typically beat Clinton among young people by about 20 points. With studies showing that most people stay in their first political party for many years, the young, ultra-liberal voters who turned out for Obama, and who are being joined by the Sanders wave, could dominate the party for a generation.

1178|Bernie Sanders lost poor voters in South Carolina by a big margin — a problem for his political revolution|"Hillary Clinton didn't just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night. She also took away one of Bernie Sanders's strongest arguments that he's the candidate who has the most working-class support. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets. That seemed to bolster his claim that his ""political revolution"" could energize millions of new low-income voters who typically don't turn out to vote. This argument, however, is much less tenable after tonight. Clinton did best among poor voters in South Carolina, taking 82 percent of those who earn under $30,000 on her way to a 37-point victory, according to exit polling by the New York Times. Here are the results by income, according to the Times: Of course, this discrepancy is largely driven by Clinton's huge 87-13 margin of victory over black voters. But that's the point outside of states like Iowa and New Hampshire, many low-income and working-class voters aren't white. Unless Sanders is able to win working-class voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country, his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started."|2022-10-10 00:00:00|REAL|Michael Sharma|The Insight|756756|59009|243|5284|United States|English|2022-09-25 04:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|3344400|2062800|1189|4.05

But if you believe the Mainstream Media and the political pundits -- Marco Rubio won the Iowa Caucus. Click here to get American Dispatch a must-read for conservatives! Just look at Tuesday's news coverage -- they marginalized Senator Cruz -- and glorified Senator Rubio. And that's the narrative. Cruz may have won -- but Rubio is more electable. And yet... the numbers in Iowa tell a very different story. One out of three evangelical voters chose Cruz -- so did four out of ten very conservative voters. And 26 percent of young voters -- 18 to 29 - -- they didn't vote for Rubio -- they also voted for Cruz. The voters recognize a simple truth. Senator Cruz has been a man of his word -- a principled conservative -- and that is something the Establishment cannot tolerate. What we are seeing is evangelicals who have been dormant in the political process that are turning out, said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. something we seen in a number of years. Perkins, who has endorsed Cruz, told me the voters are not interested in a moderate candidate. They want someone in the middle. nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead animals, Perkins said. Looking back on the results in Iowa, Perkins said there should be one take-away for voters. Do not listen to the pundits or the polls but vote your values, he said. It was values voters and the return of those voters that put Ted Cruz over the top. It's not that the pundits and politicos hate Senator Cruz - they know he can't be controlled -- and that has them terrified.

1252|Clinton’s Lead Has Evaporated in Nevada and Her Supporters Are Panicking|For months, pundits have marked Nevada in the win column for Hillary Clinton, who was thought to hold an unassailable lead with the large Hispanic population. But according to a new poll, Clinton might not win Nevada in the landslide that everyone predicted. In fact, she might not win it at all. Somehow, while everyone was focused on the showdown between her and Bernie Sanders scheduled to take place in South Carolina next week, the gap between the two Democratic rivals had quietly narrowed from 23 points in December to a gut-wrenching one point in a CNN/ORC poll released on Wednesday, just three days before the caucus. Allies in orbit are panicking, according to The Hill, as the campaign prepares for the possibility of losing a state that one Democratic strategist called tailor-made for Clinton. Latinos have long been considered a key part of supposed minority firewall against Sanders, whose victories in New Hampshire and Iowa were driven by white voters, but political observers everywhere will now have to revisit that assumption. I get it. I think anyone expected this race to look like this, one former Clinton aide said. No matter how Nevada shakes out on Saturday, anything less than a Clinton blowout could be disastrous for her campaign, especially in a state that was once so obviously one-sided that no one had bothered to poll there since December 2015. Even if Clinton ekes out a narrow win, much like she did in Iowa, the fact that Sanders was even close will prove that his minority outreach is working, giving him added momentum going into the South Carolina Democratic primary one week later. Or, as one friend of the Clintons put it in more colorful, relatable terms to The Hill: The shit will hit the fan. The surprising surge of Sanders in Nevada has only added to speculation that much like Barack Obama in 2008, the crotchety Vermont senator could present a strong challenge to once-inevitable nomination, if not snatch it from her outright. Statistics guru Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight has even laid out a numerical path to a Sanders victory, projecting how much he needs to outperform expectations to secure the nomination. In Nevada, assuming she holds a 12-point lead nationally, Hillary should be winning by 15 points. That may not be happening anymore. If it that could mean Clinton is in for one hell of a fight.|2022-10-04 02:00:00|REAL|Samantha Chen|National Courier|410786|15361|580|1766|South Korea|English|2022-09-14 18:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|2833200|1162800|2357|9.666666666666666
1258|Republican Debate: Trump's absence leaves three winners and two losers|"The intentional winner of the Fox News Republican debate Thursday night was Marco Rubio. He had a really good debate. He was substantive and sharp, clear and polished. He came across as likable. He came across as someone who knows foreign policy. The accidental winner, though, was Ted Cruz. The debate got off to a rough start with Cruz. The other candidates were piling on the man in the center seat. His campaign had expected it. His engagement with the moderators made him seem less likable. But the moderators, unintentionally and accidentally, solidified support for him and got fence sitters between Trump and Cruz off the fence. What about ObamaCare? the moderators asked Cruz. He wanted it repealed and replaced. Why does Washington hate you? they asked Cruz. That question let Cruz give a dissertation on his efforts to clean up and shrink Washington. Then there was the issue of the ethanol lobby that gave Cruz a minute of clear answers on level playing fields and ending government subsidies. Cruz could not have asked for a better set up of questions at a time when his favorables are vastly higher than other Republicans in Washington. Without Donald Trump, the tone of the debate was lower energy, but filled with much more optimism. The Megyn Kelly Accountability Project was a welcome addition to the debate and forced the candidates to own their records or flip-flops. Jeb Bush had a far better night without Trump there. I was surprised there was not a clash with Kasich, given his rise in Iowa. But Bush held his own and Kasich annoyed as always. The ultimate winner, however, was Megyn Kelly. After days of being beaten up by the Trump forces, she showed she is a sharp, credible journalist who is willing to ask tough questions and hold the candidates accountable for their prior statements. The video montages and prior records of the candidates were fair game and she forced them to answer. Overall, though the debate had lower energy than prior ones, it was wonderful to have the candidates have to own their records. As for losers, that had to be Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who had their kneel before Zod moment showing up at a Donald Trump rally where everyone treated Donald Trump as the conquering hero.

1267|Huckabee Appearing at Trump Event in Iowa|"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has announced plans to attend Donald Trump's fundraising rally for wounded warriors, slated to take place in Des Moines, Iowa, Thursday night - the same time as the Republican debate. ""He'll do the undercard debate on Fox News and then head over to the Trump rally, which is about 10 minutes away from the debate site,"" CBN's David Brody said. Read more about Huckabee's appearance at the Trump rally at The Brody File. The news comes as Trump reaffirmed his decision to boycott the GOP debate. That event will be hosted by Fox News, which he has accused of unfair treatment. ""I don't like being taken advantage of,"" Trump said in an interview Wednesday on Fox, signaling he wasn't boycotting the highly rated network completely. Trump threatened to boycott the debate if Fox kept Megyn Kelly as debate moderator, but it was statement from Fox News that led him to make his final decision. That statement said the leaders of Iran and Russia ""both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president"" and that ""Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings,"" reports The Associated Press. The other GOP candidates are hoping they can emerge Thursday night from the shadow Trump has cast over the race. ""I think it'll hurt him that he's not showing up in the Iowa debate four days before the Iowa caucuses,"" former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told CNN. Trump's absence will likely bring more attention to Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is hoping for a third place finish in Iowa.

You'll be able to view a live stream online at  After skipping out on the last GOP debate and losing the Iowa caucuses Donald Trump has announced that he will show up this time. He'll be joined by Iowa winner Ted Cruz and Iowa ""media winner"" Marco Rubio, whose unexpectedly competitive performance in the caucuses has bolstered his prospects for winning the nomination in the eyes of political elites. Ben Carson, who finished a weak fourth in Iowa and whose candidacy has been in decline for months, will also be in attendance, though his campaign seems like it might not be going for too much longer. Watch: Ted Cruz trolls Donald Trump in opening remarks of last Republican debate Then there are three other candidates Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Chris Christie who are desperately hoping for a strong performance in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary to keep them in the race. Bush, Kasich, and Christie, who are all establishment-friendly candidates, are all considered rivals to Rubio, who did far better than them in Iowa. So expect them to make a last attempt at taking Rubio down at tonight's debate. Conversely, the debate gives Rubio a big opportunity to outshine those establishment rivals right before the New Hampshire primary. If Rubio outperforms Bush, Kasich, and Christie in the Granite State too, they'll all likely drop out of the race soon clearing the way for Rubio to be the mainstream Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz. If Rubio stumbles in New Hampshire, though, the race could remain muddled for a bit longer. Since the GOP field has shrunk, there will be no undercard debate for candidates who aren't polling as well this time around. But, much to her disappointment, Carly Fiorina missed ABC's polling cutoff to qualify for this debate she and former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore are the two remaining candidates who will be left out.

Our next commander in chief must define a strategic vision for the country and accept accountability for past actions. Webb, a Navy secretary in the Reagan administration who became a Democratic Virginia senator, in October dropped out of the 2016 Democrat presidential primary amid low poll numbers and little name recognition.

U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the 2012 terror attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

""I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.""

Ron Paul, had built there four years ago. His prospects were similarly bleak both in national polling and in New Hampshire, which is up next Tuesday. Left off the main debate stage last month for his poor standing in surveys (he instead boycotted the so-called undercard debate), Paul faced being passed over again at Saturday's GOP debate. His end-of-the-year campaign finance report showed a depleted bank account, too, with just $1.3 million remaining. And Paul, unlike his rivals, had another campaign he was running simultaneously to worry about his Senate re-election bid. Though the first-term senator starts with the advantage in the GOP-leaning state, he drew a strong Democratic challenger last month in Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. Paul had to jump through hoops just to be able to run for both Senate and president at the same time. Last year he persuaded the state party to hold a March caucus instead of a May primary so he could legally be on both ballots.

Fiorina, once a breakout star of the GOP who fought her way from the low-polling undercard debates to the primetime stage, has been having trouble in the past few weeks maintaining her momentum.

Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News contributor and one of the generals she said quit, actually retired before Obama took office. Fiorina also said Gens. David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal resigned because they disagreed with the administration; but, in fact, retirement came following revelations he shared classified information with his alleged mistress and biographer while McChrystal called it quits after he was quoted criticizing Obama in a Rolling Stone article. Fiorina was also pressed by host Chris Wallace about a digital ad paid for by a super PAC supporting Fiorina that links her to Margaret Iron Lady Thatcher, the first female prime minister of Britain. Mrs. Fiorina, respectfully, that a little over the top? the anchor asked. Many people have commented on the comparison and flattered by it, frankly, she said. Margaret Thatcher was a great leader for her nation at a pivotal and perilous time. When asked by Wallace about her stagnant poll numbers, Fiorina said she was happy with her position and that she is where she wants to be. She quipped, People make up their minds late, and if the polls at this stage and in earlier states were true we would have had President Howard Dean, President Rudy Giuliani, and by the way, we would have already had President Hillary Clinton."|2022-10-08 06:00:00|REAL|Samantha Chen|Sunrise Chronicle|531341|53711|230|5537|China|English|2022-09-03 19:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|0|True|3193200|216000|2388|3.8333333333333335

1380|The Many Faces of Iowa’s Caucus Voters|caucuses are the embodiment of retail politics, typically rewarding candidates who build county at a time. Social conservatives have asserted their influence in recent years, with conservative Rick Santorum narrowly edging out the more centrist Mitt Romney in 2012. But the state a monolith, and demographic characteristics may help handicap the Republican race. Data from The Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls suggest a GOP primary electorate defined by three broad lanes: a highly religious bloc that supports socially conservative candidates such as Ted Cruz and Ben Carson; a more moderate slice of voters with higher incomes and education levels who back candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush; and a third constituency of Donald Trump supporters representing a secular, populist movement. Viewed through that lens, a look at where each type of candidate might build a winning coalition in Iowa.

1384|Donald Trump’s statement on the Fox News debate has to be seen to be believed|Donald Trump announced Tuesday night that he would not participate in the Fox News debate set for Thursday -- after Fox head honcho Roger Ailes told The Fix's Cal Borchers that FNC personality (and Trump nemesis) Megyn Kelly would stay on as a moderator. Trump's campaign then released the statement below to further explain his decision. It is amazing -- even by Trump standards. I annotated it using Genius; sign up and annotate alongside me! As someone who wrote one of the best-selling business books of all time, The Art of the Deal, who has built an incredible company, including some of the most valuable and iconic assets in the world, and as someone who has a personal net worth of many billions of dollars, Mr. Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one. FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts. Unlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump play games. There have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity. He will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians.

""If you had told me a year ago that two days out from the Iowa caucuses we would be neck and neck, effectively tied for first place in the state of Iowa, I would have been thrilled,"" Cruz told reporters. The latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll, released hours before Cruz held a rally here, showed Trump retaking his lead in Iowa. Cruz previously held the poll's top spot. The latest Iowa Poll showed Trump at 28% support among likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers and Cruz at 23%. Even so, Cruz considers himself in a ""dead heat"" with Trump for the top spot. Cruz pointed to an increase in attacks against him as proof that he still has strong political standing in Iowa. ""Everyone in the field is running millions of dollars in attack ads. We saw it in the last debate where everyone lined up to toss their attacks. fine. That goes with the territory,"" Cruz said. tell you be a lot more worried right now if nobody was attacking me. Then that would be concerning: What do they know that we The U.S. senator and presidential hopeful was ending a five-stop day. Cruz had set the rally here as the location for a one-on-one debate he challenged Trump to earlier in the week. Trump did not show up. Throughout the day, Cruz gave a version of his usual stump speech, laying out his agenda for what he'll do if he makes it to the White House. It includes repealing Obamacare and Common Core, opening an investigation into Planned Parenthood, instituting a flat tax, and eliminating the IRS and a slate of other federal agencies. Linda Imsland, of Hubbard, said she supports Cruz, during his stop in her town 25 miles north of Ames. ""He believes with all his heart that the Constitution needs to be upheld,"" she said. ""I believe a very patriotic man. I believe that he cares about the country, and I think it scares him to death to see where headed, and it does me, too."" Cruz has been making his final pitches throughout Iowa while counting down the hours to caucus night. This is now your time. This is the men and women of Iowa, the time to look candidates in the eyes and make the judgment: Who do I trust?

The mailer gave the recipient, along with their neighbors, poor grades based on their individual voting history. On one side, the mailer reads: ""ELECTION ALERT: VOTER VIOLATION,"" ""PUBLIC RECORD"" and ""FURTHER ACTION NEEDED."" The other side of the mailer says ""VOTING VIOLATION"" in red letters at the top before text that reads: ""You are receiving this election notice because of low expected voter turnout in your area.

Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart confirmed to CNN that the mailer was from the Cruz campaign. ""Accusing citizens of Iowa of a ""voting violation"" based on Iowa Caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act,"" Pate said in his statement. ""There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting. Any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and I believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses."" Pate continued, ""Additionally, the Iowa Secretary of State's Office never 'grades' voters. Nor does the Secretary of State maintain records related to Iowa Caucus participation,"" Pate said. ""Also, the Iowa Secretary of State does not 'distribute' voter records. They are available for purchase for political purposes only, under Iowa Code."" Cruz, however, was defiant to reporters when asked about the mailer in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday night.

1397|How Predictive Are Iowa And New Hampshire?|"How Predictive Are Iowa And New Hampshire? Iowa and New Hampshire get a lot of attention, but their records in picking presidents, let alone nominees, is spotty (as you can see from the chart above). But that doesn't mean the states don't matter. They have been effective at weeding the field of candidates, and they're about momentum for those later states. Plus, in the last 40 years, just one person has gone on to win the presidency after losing both Iowa and New Hampshire Bill Clinton. Here's how the predictability of the states breaks down by party: New Hampshire has been better at picking nominees for Republicans. Since 1976: Two became president: Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Iowa, on the other hand, has picked: Here's the thing, though: No Republican has become the nominee in the last 40 years without winning either Iowa or New Hampshire. Iowa has been slightly better than New Hampshire at picking nominees on Democratic side. In fact, since 1976: A whopping six eventual nominees have won Iowa, including the last three (Barack Obama, John Kerry and Al Gore). Two Iowa Democratic winners have become president Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama. Five nominees over that same time ... Just one became president Carter. Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan all lost Iowa but went on to win the presidency. Bill Clinton didn't win either Iowa or New Hampshire in 1992, but was still declared ""The Comeback Kid"" after his second-place finish in the New Hampshire. The person who led the longest in Iowa in the crowded Republican field in 2015, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, was ... Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. He led for six months, from February to August, before dropping out of the race after a series of missteps. If Donald Trump wins both Iowa and New Hampshire, it would be the first time a non-incumbent Republican has done so in 40 years."|2022-10-05 03:00:00|REAL|Owen Rodriguez|The Chronicle|123704|52904|30|9430|Ukraine|English|2022-09-13 15:00:00|Reseña|1|True|1065600|2923200|1898|0.5
1400|Carson threatens to leave Republican Party|"The retired neurosurgeon lashed out Friday morning at reports of a recent closed-door meeting of Republican establishment leaders focused on deep divisions within the GOP electorate, particularly the continued strength of billionaire businessman Donald Trump. The Washington Post reported that the group, including Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, discussed the possibility of a ""brokered national convention"" if there isn't a clear winner in the party's months long primary election season. ""If this was the beginning of a plan to subvert the will of the voters and replace it with the will of the political elite, I assure you Donald Trump will not be the only one leaving the party,"" Carson said in a statement that referenced Trump's repeated threats to leave the GOP if treated ""unfairly."" ""I pray that the report in the Post this morning was incorrect,"" Carson added. ""If it is correct, every voter who is standing for change must know they are being betrayed. I won't stand for it."" The Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to questions about the meeting and Carson's threat. A third-party run by Carson or Trump would be a nightmare scenario for the GOP. While Carson is slipping in recent polls, an independent bid that siphoned even a few percentage points away from the party's nominee could make it all but impossible for the Republican nominee to win the general election. Spokesman Doug Watts said Carson was appalled at reports suggesting that Republican leaders were trying to manipulate the party's presidential nominating process. He acknowledged that Carson, like Trump and the rest of Republican field, signed a pledge not to launch a third-party bid. ""The pledge isn't meaningless,"" Watts said. ""But he signed the pledge based on everybody playing by the rules."|2022-10-07 01:00:00|REAL|Olivia Kumar|Times Today|738424|68375|27|1051|United States|English|2022-09-26 01:00:00|Artículo de investigación|1|True|3088800|2138400|1868|0.45

Jeb Bush (R) might have come away a big winner. Speaking with Fox moderator Megyn Kelly shortly after the debate ended, Krauthammer said the former Florida governor turned in a strong performance possibly the best of the night out of all the candidates on stage. ""I thought it was, interestingly, the best night that Jeb had in all of the debates,"" Krauthammer said. ""And I might even say I think he might have had the best night of the group in this debate."" ""He was very strong. He had one moment where he kind of flipped back to Marco Rubio on the question of immigration,"" he said. Krauthammer was referring to a back-and-forth between Bush and Rubio on supporting a path to citizenship on for immigrants living in the country illegally. Rubio said that Bush used to support a path to citizenship to which Bush said, ""So did you."" Bush then continued: ""I think it's important for people in elected office to try to force consensus to solve problems. There's never going to be a perfect bill. ... You shouldn't cut and run. You should stick with it. ... He cut and run."" He was referring to the 2013 immigration bill that Rubio co-sponsored. ""What I found ironic here is it was kind of a reversal of that moment in one of the earlier debates when there was a tangle between Rubio and Bush and Rubio turned it very strongly against Bush,"" Krauthammer said.

1458|Carson, GOP White House candidates critical of Obama’s Syria plan for 50 Special Ops troops|"Republican White House candidates on Sunday criticized President plan to deploy 50 Special Operations troops in Syria to fight the Islamic State terror group. Sending 50 American Special Forces into Syria in the eyes of ISIL shows that Obama is not all in, candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Fox News Sunday. It is a sign of weakness to ISIL. They have sized Obama up and they think he's weak. Graham, a defense hawk and Armed Services Committee member, argued that such a small group will have no chance of winning the fight to destroy the Islamic State, whose recent and unexpected rise has resulted in the militant group occupying large swatches of Iraq and Syria. He downplayed the possibility of a clash between U.S. forces and Russian forces in Syria, sent to protect the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. There may be some potential, said Graham, who has advocated for sending more troops to the region to battle the Islamic State. But I see Russia and Iran mopping the floor with Obama ... . Russia is all in with Iran to support Assad. The White announcement Friday to deploy the non-combat troops comes roughly two years after Obama vowed that he would not put American boots on the ground in Syria."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest argued the move is not a change in strategy, only an intensification of the plan to help local forces fight the terror group. Ben Carson, another GOP presidential candidate, said Sunday that he supports Obama's plan in part but that it fails to go far enough. I think a move in the right direction ... certainly in terms of helping to guide what the Air Force is doing, he told This Week. But I think that that's only a small part of it. We need to have a much bigger plan when it comes to battling the global jihadist because they have big ideals. Carson, a first-time candidate, said that if elected he would address Russian President Vladimir efforts in Syria and that the United States should establish a no-fly zone in the region. This is not the first criticism of most recent decision. On Saturday, GOP contender Donald Trump also suggested the move was a half-measure. ""I think we have a president who just doesn't know what he's doing,"" Trump told CNN before a campaign stop in Norfolk, Va. You either do it or you don't do it. However, Trump, also a first-time candidate, declined to say whether he would deploy more troops to Syria."|2022-10-05 19:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|City Beat|258631|38508|732|4690|Spain|English|2022-09-12 04:00:00|Noticia internacional|1|True|939600|2980800|2424|12.2

Released ahead of Wednesday's third Republican presidential primary debate, the CBS News/New York Times Poll showed Carson leading nationally with 26 percent, to Trump's 22 percent. The survey follows a string of Iowa polls that showed the retired neurosurgeon pulling ahead in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Trump, who had led the field nationally and in key states since the summer, has tried to downplay the results but on Tuesday acknowledged Carson is gaining momentum. ""Ben Carson is now doing well,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday morning on MSNBC. At the same time, Trump has made clear he plans to challenge Carson at Wednesday's primary debate as the two battle for the top spot. Trump previously called Carson ""low energy"" and questioned his immigration stance. On Tuesday, he predicted Carson would have to deal with more scrutiny from all directions. ""One thing I know about a frontrunner, you get analyzed 15 different ways from China. A lot of things will come out,"" he said. He continued to tout his own numbers and support. ""I have tremendous crowds and tremendous love in the room and, you know, we seem to have hit a chord. But some of these polls coming out, I don't quite get it. I was No. 1 pretty much in Iowa from the beginning, and I would say we're doing very well there. So I'm a little bit surprised,"" he said. ""The other polls, as you know, in other states are extraordinary."" The most recent Iowa poll showing Carson ahead was conducted by Monmouth University and released Monday. It showed Carson leading Trump by 14 points, his biggest lead to date. Trump has led the Republican field nationally in almost every poll until now. The CBS News/New York Times survey showed the rest of the candidates trailing in single digits. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was in third with 8 percent, followed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former HP chief Carly Fiorina with 7 percent.

1491|Cruz Raises $20 Million In Fourth Quarter|"Ted Cruz raised nearly $20 million in the past three months, according to an internal memo obtained by NBC News - a significant haul for the Texas senator heading into the final month before the Iowa caucus. ""We're showing we have the strength going into the Iowa caucus,"" a campaign aide told NBC News tonight, adding: ""If people want to get behind a candidate who can go the distance, we're showing we've got that."" It's Cruz's biggest fundraising total yet, surpassing the $12.2 million he brought in last quarter. And it brings the Texas senator's total figure for the year to $45 million. In the previous three months, Ben Carson - then the rising candidate in polling - brought in a similar $20 million. And Marco Rubio brought in just $6 million. Cruz is the first candidate to report his or her fundraising totals for this quarter, which technically ends on Thursday. At the beginning of October, Cruz's campaign had the most cash on hand -- $13.8 million - but it has yet to publicly release what its coffers now hold. The formidable fundraising by Cruz who often highlights on the trail that his campaign is built to last is also matched by hefty fundraising by several super PACs backing his candidacy. Through September, the super PACs had raised $38 million and to date, the organizations have spent little of that money. For Cruz, the extra cash gives the candidate expanded funds to potentially buy advertising in the upcoming early states.

1505|Hillary Clinton says early lead was 'artificial'|"Clinton, in an appearance on ""The Tonight Show,"" agreed that she and Sanders are ""in a tight race,"" a fact that she finds ""pretty exciting."" After noting she and Sanders are close, host Jimmy Fallon reminded Clinton that she once ""had a 20-point lead at one point."" ""That is really artificial, all of those early soundings and polls,"" Clinton said. ""Once you get into it, this is a Democratic election for our nominee and it gets really close, exciting. And it really depends upon on who can make the best case that you can be the nominee to beat whoever the Republicans put up and try to get your folks who support you to come out."" She added, ""I find it pretty exciting. This is not a job they give away. You really do have to work hard for. It is the hardest job in the world, so, I get up everyday and go right at it."" In mid-2015, as both Sanders and Clinton launched their respective campaigns, polls showed the former secretary of state with leads as high as 60 points nationally In the last week, however, Sanders has begun to close Clinton's lead in national and early state polls. A New York Times/CBS Poll found Clinton's national lead at 7 percentage points. Clinton's interview with Fallon was her second appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" as a presidential candidate and came on the same night as the Fox Business Network hosted a Republican debate. The former secretary of state told Fallon that she usually doesn't watch the debates live because she loves ""to be able to fast forward"" through them. Fallon said the Republican candidates ""might say something bad about"" Clinton during the debate, suggesting she should ""have a drinking game where every time they say your name you do a shot."" ""I don't think I would make it past the first half hour,"" Clinton remarked. Fallon also goaded Clinton into a comment on Donald Trump by telling the former senator that the Republican front-runner has been talking about her on the campaign trail. Clinton's response: ""He is a lot more obsessed with me than I am with him."" Clinton and Fallon closed the appearance by carrying out a mock interview, with Fallon acting like he was interviewing Clinton for the president of the United States. ""How did you hear about the position,"" Fallon asked. ""Are you willing to relocate,"" Fallon followed up. ""For the right job, I am,"" Clinton responded. And Fallon's final question: ""Lastly, is there an email address (where) we can reach you?"" Clinton's response: ""You can follow me on Snapchat."|2022-09-19 21:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|Evening Echo|836094|87252|298|9282|Tanzania|English|2022-09-14 02:00:00|Crónica|0|True|1105200|1605600|2488|4.966666666666667
1506|Jeb Bush Picks Up Endorsement From Lindsey Graham|"Former GOP presidential hopeful Linsdey Graham has announced his endorsement of Jeb Bush for president. Graham's presidential campaign went nowhere, but as a senator from the early voting state of South Carolina he hopes to still have some clout. Graham praised Bush's temperament Friday morning, following Thursday night's GOP debate. ""He hasn't tried to get ahead in a contested primary by embracing demagoguery ... he's not running to be commander-in-chief by running people down,"" he said. That was clearly a reference to Donald Trump. Bush returned the admiration, calling Graham a ""patriot."" ""He loves this country. You just hear it how he spoke from his heart about what's at stake here. What's at stake is our way of life,"" Bush said. Jeb Bush still slumping in polls has been looking for a way to jump-start his campaign, but an endorsement from a former candidate who couldn't break through either probably won't give Bush the upswing he needs. With the Iowa caucuses fewer than three weeks away, he's polling behind Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson both nationally and in Iowa. Bush was unable to stand out from the field once again at Thursday's Republican presidential debate. And Bush's donors are reportedly getting skittish, saying it's only a matter of time before he drops out. Politico reported that several donors said they are now waiting for what one former George W. Bush administration appointee described as a ""family hall pass"" to switch to another campaign after the New Hampshire primary."|2022-09-21 22:00:00|REAL|Alexander Lee|The Daily Dispatch|647547|79766|301|1571|Vietnam|English|2022-09-19 04:00:00|Noticia internacional|1|True|1544400|1782000|1527|5.016666666666667

1518|Clinton, Sanders to Face Off in 1st Democrat Debate|"LAS VEGAS The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas. It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates. This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way. One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules. Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too. Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages. With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party. ""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set."" So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage. Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator. He's trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few months. As for Clinton herself, she's trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite, then ran into a buzz saw called Barack Obama. This time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders."|2022-09-29 18:00:00|REAL|Ella Sharma|Global Gazette|831695|49774|263|8574|Tanzania|English|2022-09-23 06:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|1897200|2458800|1990|4.383333333333334

1521|Carly Fiorina: Ted Cruz says 'whatever' to get elected|"Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive and Cruz's rival for the GOP nomination, hit Cruz in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" She kept up her criticism of the Texas senator for his 2013 push for a government shutdown in an ill-fated attempt to repeal President Barack Obama's signature health care law. ""Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa,"" Fiorina said Sunday. Recordings of Cruz speaking about gay marriage to donors in New York City appear to differ in style, but not substance, from his speeches to conservative supporters. ""He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he's going to do as he pleases,"" she said. ""I think people are tired of a political class that promises much and delivers much of the same."" Cruz on conference call: I'll win, but attacks are coming In the interview, Fiorina, a Stanford alum, also dismissed social media criticism of her New Year's Day tweet in which she said she was rooting for Iowa over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.

1522|Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton has 'caused tremendous death'|"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has a new attack line against Hillary Clinton: ""She has caused death."" Trump raised the stakes against Clinton on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, insisting that as secretary of State in President Obama's first term, Clinton's decisions led to unnecessary deaths on both sides in the Middle East. ""She has caused tremendous death with incompetent decisions,"" Trump said. ""She caused a lot of the problems that we have right now. You could say she caused the migration. ""The entire world has been upset. The entire world, it's a different place. During Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's term, she's done a horrible job."" As he has said before, Trump argued that getting rid of Saddam Hussein in Iraq -- a policy of Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush -- has led to the rise of the Islamic State. ""All of this has led to tremendous death and destruction,"" he said. ""And she, for the most part, was in charge of it, along with Obama."" Trump acknowledged that by calling for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States, he was giving radical Islam a rallying cry. The terrorist group al-Shabaab is now using a clip of Trump in calling for Muslims to join jihad or leave the U.S. ""What am I going to do? I have to say what I have to say,"" Trump said. ""And you know what I have to say? There's a problem. We have to find out what is the problem. And we have to solve that problem."" During the interview, Trump also disagreed with Obama on the need for more gun control -- particularly if the president tries to move the issue by executive action rather than working with a recalcitrant Congress. ""All they want to do is blame the guns. And it's not the gun that pulls the trigger,"" he said. ""So I don't like it. I don't like what he's doing."" Rather than fiddle with the Second Amendment, Trump said mental health is the problem. ""We should build, like, institutions for people that are sickos,"" he said. ""We have sickos all over the place. And that's the problem."" Despite his lead in national polls, Trump said he will spend about $2 million per week on advertising in the coming weeks leading to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. ""I think I'm probably wasting the money,"" he said. ""But I'm $35 million under budget....

1528|Trump Continues His Embrace of Putin|"After Russian President Vladimir Putin complimented Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate lavished praise on the heavy-handed leader and U.S. adversary. Trump said Friday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that, ""sure"" he's happy about the nice things Putin said about him. ""When people call you 'brilliant' it's always good, especially when the person heads up Russia,"" Trump said. After the program's hosts pointed out that Putin kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries, Trump still embraced the Russian leader. ""At least he's a leader unlike what we have in this country,"" Trump said. After the hosts repeated that he kills journalists and political opponents, Trump still avoided criticizing Putin. ""Our country does plenty of killing also,"" Trump added. Earlier this week, Putin said Trump is a ""bright personality, a talented person, no doubt about it."" ""It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,"" Trump said in a statement. Putin has become a main adversary to the U.S. Tensions escalated once Putin re-entered office in 2012. Shortly after he invaded Crimea in Ukraine, further escalating tensions. While Republican presidential candidates have talked tough in response to Putin on the campaign trail, often criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her ""reset"" with Russia shortly after President Barack Obama entered office in 2009. Even New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie saying he would shoot down Russian planes over Syria if the U.S. and allies imposed a no-fly zone, most have been silent into Trump's embrace of the Russian leader. But former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has adopted the mantle of the Trump attack dog, has been the only candidate who has come out and criticized Trump on the issue. Brian Walsh, Republican strategist at Rokk Solutions said Trump's comments are ""a new level of outrageous."" He added that of any of the candidates that should respond, en. Ted Cruz should because of his refusal to ever criticize Trump. Sen. Cruz's silence suggests he endorses (Trump's positions) in some way,"" Walsh said.

1532|What Walker's Departure Means for GOP Field|"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a once rising star of the GOP presidential pack, has dropped out of the race. Now the field is scrambling to re-align. Just this summer, Walker led the Republican field in Iowa. But on Monday, he called it quits and suggested that someone could emerge from a smaller pool of candidates with a clear conservative alternative to the current frontrunner, Donald Trump. ""Today, I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field. With that in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately,"" he said. But will others drop out so that support can build around an alternative to Trump? None are expected to do so anytime soon. In fact, they're all vying for the Walker campaign assets. Some believe that Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., will benefit the most from Walker's departure. They're both considered ""fresh faces"" with next generation appeal. Late Monday, Rubio was already welcoming Walker staff to his team, as was Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The latest CNN poll shows political outsiders Trump, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson leading the presidential pack, with Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in fourth and fifth place respectively. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is battling off an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. She's also waiting to see if Vice President Joe Biden decides to enter the race. In her latest campaign move, the former secretary of state is promising not only to protect Obamacare from GOP plans to repeal it but to improve it. ""As the latest census numbers show, the number of uninsured continues to fall and Americans are now seeing, hearing, and feeling the full benefits of the Affordable Care Act,"" a Clinton campaign official said Saturday. It's already a presidential campaign year that no one could have predicted, and voters have never had so many candidates to consider. But whether any of them will follow Walker's advice to lead by falling back is unlikely for now."|2022-09-28 23:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|Daily Beacon|101425|22739|241|5388|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-24 12:00:00|Columna|1|True|2390400|2005200|2112|4.016666666666667

This tweet from Inna Shevchenko, an activist with the feminist group Femen who was speaking at the event, is especially chilling: Shevchenko's tweet literalizes the broader threat posed by attacks on people whose only crime is speaking their mind. When terrorists attack people for drawing Muhammed, the intent isn't just to kill these people: it's to create a deterrent to anyone who might, in the future, use their speech rights in a way that radical Islamists don't like. Writer Timothy Garton Ash calls this the ""assassin's veto:"" the idea that killers can use fear to put limits on free speech.

1548|Carson Doubles Down on 'Muslim' Comments: 'Sharia Inconsistent with Constitution'|The Islamic faith consistent with the U.S. Constitution, and a Muslim be president, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said. I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation, Carson said on 'Meet the Press' on Sunday. Late Sunday, he doubled down on those comments in an interview with The Hill. I do not believe Sharia is consistent with the Constitution of this country, Carson told The Hill. Muslims feel that their religion is very much a part of your public life and what you do as a public official, and inconsistent with our principles and our Constitution. Editor's Note: Is Ben Carson Your Candidate for 2016? Vote Here. Earlier, Carson told NBC's Chuck Todd that the religious beliefs of a president would matter if his or her faith was inconsistent with U.S. values. His view contrasted with that of Donald Trump, the billionaire front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, who said on the program that a Muslim as president is something that could happen in the future. Trump said he knows many Muslims who are fabulous, but a very severe problem with some Muslims around the world -- comments he repeated on other Sunday broadcasts.

1584|Trump again won’t rule out a third-party run|"Donald Trump is not ruling out a run for president as an independent if things go south for the front-runner in the Republican race. ""I'm going to have to see what happens,"" he told George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I will see what happens. I have to be treated fairly."" Trump was responding to a Wall Street Journal report that Republican operatives are considering banding together donors from the other GOP campaigns in a bid to knock Trump off the top spot. Their efforts are taking on increased urgency as the first-in-the-nation Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses near and Trump leads the crowded GOP field for the fourth consecutive month, according to a new national Washington Post-ABC News poll. Some candidates, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, also are showing more willingness lately to directly attack Trump. On Sunday, Trump said his measure of whether he would support the eventual GOP nominee is whether he is treated ""fairly"" in the campaign, a line he often uses when talking about a third-party run. ""When I did this, I said I have to be treated fairly,"" Trump told Stephanopoulos. ""If treated fairly, fine. All I want to do is [have] a level playing field."" Trump has given competing signals throughout the campaign about whether he would run as a third-party candidate. He didn't raise his hand in the Republican Party's first presidential debate, in August, when moderators asked the candidates whether they would pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee. But in September, Trump signed a pledge saying he would support the eventual nominee instead of opposing him or her in a third-party run. If Republican operatives succeed in knocking Trump off his perch, their plan could backfire if he then runs as an independent. A July Washington Post-ABC News poll found that in a hypothetical general election matchup between Bush and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Clinton led 50 percent to 44 percent. But throw a third-party Trump run into the mix, and the poll found that he would tear support away Bush and give Clinton a 16-point lead."|2022-10-04 04:00:00|REAL|Marcus Liu|Newsline|378173|89472|165|1842|Argentina|English|2022-09-28 15:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|2361600|2840400|2138|2.75

1602|Poll gives Biden edge over Clinton against GOP candidates; VP meets with Trumka|"A new national poll shows Vice President Biden faring better than Hillary Clinton in match-ups against top Republican presidential candidates, as the VP weighs jumping into the race -- and meets Thursday with a top labor leader. Fox News has learned that Biden is meeting later in the day with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. This comes after he met last weekend with liberal icon, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He's making the rounds amid a flurry of polls showing Clinton potentially vulnerable. The latest Quinnipiac University National Poll shows Clinton polling better than Biden who is not a declared candidate in the Democratic primary race. But the poll gives Biden the slight edge when squared against leading GOP contenders. ""Note to Biden: They like you, they really like you, or they like you more than the others, Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement. The poll shows Biden leading Republican front-runner Donald Trump, 48-40 percent. He also leads former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 45-39 percent. The former secretary of state also edges those candidates, but not by as much. She leads Trump 45-41 percent; she leads Bush 42-40 percent. Both candidates narrowly lead Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The survey comes on the heels of another showing Biden running strong in head-to-head match-ups against Republicans in key swing states. Biden continues to weigh a potential bid, as Clinton struggles with the controversy over her personal email and server, and faces eroding poll numbers. The Quinnipiac poll showed her with her worst favorability rating yet with only 39 percent holding a favorable view of her, compared with 51 percent who Clinton weighed in on the Biden rumors Wednesday, saying in Iowa that, He should have the space and the opportunity to decide what he wants to do. going to be running for president regardless, she added. The Quinnipiac poll of 1,563 registered voters was conducted Aug. 20-25. It has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points."|2022-09-26 11:00:00|REAL|Zoe Lee|City Beat|429052|63418|345|3016|China|English|2022-09-10 05:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|770400|2174400|2029|5.75

1617|Poll: Hillary Clinton tops Donald Trump, GOP field on handling terror|Americans trust Hillary Clinton to handle the threat of terrorism more than any of the leading Republican candidates for president in the wake of the Paris attacks, according to a new poll. The Democratic front-runner leads most of the GOP candidates by a wide margin, and tops GOP front-runner Donald Trump by 8 points and second-place Ben Carson by 9 points. The closest gap is with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is within the margin of error of Clinton, with Clinton at 46% and Bush at 43%. The Washington Post-ABC News poll out Monday asked Americans if they would trust Clinton or one of five Republican candidates more. She led Trump 50% to 42%, Carson 49% to 40%, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz 47% to 40%, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio 47% to 43%. The poll did not ask about Clinton's Democratic opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The poll also found that Americans strongly disapprove of how President Barack Obama is handling ISIS and the threat of terror broadly. Americans disapprove of how Obama is handling ISIS in Iraq and Syria, with 57% who disapprove and 35% who approve. Fifty-four percent also disapprove of his handling of the threat of terrorism, compared with 40% who approve. Questioners surveyed 1,004 American adults by telephone Nov. 16 to Nov. 19, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

1626|Megyn Kelly tears into Ted Cruz over ridiculous debate demands: “Would we have to submit our voting records to you?”|Megyn Kelly has been none too impressed with Republican presidential reaction to their third primary debate and days long tantrum about the CNBC moderators after all, she did see her own revolt of Fox News viewers following her moderation of the first GOP debate so on her Wednesday night program, Kelly confronted Texas Senator Ted Cruz about his recent demand that future GOP debate moderators strictly be Republicans. Making clear that he thought the debates so far have been terrific, Cruz responded to New Jersey Governor Chris suggestion that Republican presidential candidates stop whining and move on from last debate. Cruz said he was happy to debate any of the candidates, anywhere, and denied that he planned to sign onto a GOP list of demands for future debates. But then Cruz explained that his only problem with the Republican primary debates has been the fact that they are moderated by what he calls liberals. Why is it that we have Republican primary debates that are moderated by liberal Democrats, Cruz asked, repeating the argument he made on Fox Hannity moments following last CNBC debate. I think that makes any sense, he told Kelly. The one rule change that I think the RNC ought to think about is saying that if you have never in your life voted in a Republican Party primary, that you be moderating a Republican primary debate, Cruz argued. Let me challenge you on that, Kelly offered. Do you have any idea whether Bret Baier or Chris Wallace have ever voted in a Republican primary? I have no idea, Cruz admitted chucklingly, before defending his assertion by revealing the secret that neither Kelly, nor Wallace, nor Baier could plausibly be described as liberals. Would we have to submit our voting records to you? Kelly shot back after noting that proposed rule could potentially box out some Fox News anchors from moderating GOP debates. Megyn, it is not complicated, Cruz insisted. In a primary, have liberals moderating.

1647|Carly Fiorina Says Donald Trump 'Taps Into an Anger'|Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said Sunday she could see how competitor Donald Trump's immigration rhetoric, which has gotten him in some hot water over the past few weeks, resonates with some voters. Asked on ABC's This Week whether she would support him if he became the nominee, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said, I have been in New Hampshire now for six days, and I have not been asked a single question about Donald Trump. Last week in the first-in-the-nation primary state, she said Trump didn't represent her or her party. On the other hand, she said on ABC, I think Donald Trump taps into an anger that I hear every day. People are angry that a commonsense thing like securing the border or ending sanctuary cities is somehow considered extreme. It's not extreme, it's common sense. We need to secure the border. While decrying illegal immigration in his campaign announcement speech on June 16, Trump called the Mexican immigrants entering the the U.S. criminals and rapists.

1674|Jeb Bush just proved that Dubya was the smart one all along|"The popular conservative argument that George W. Bush ""kept us safe"" from terrorism has always been somewhat undermined by the fact that the vast majority of domestic terrorism deaths in American history occurred while Bush was in office. But it turns out that it took Donald Trump to offer an argument that Democrats have always shied away from, telling Bloomberg TV, ""When you talk about George Bush, I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time."" As phrased by Trump, the argument is provocative to the point of poor taste, but in attempting to rebut it, Jeb Bush went and made exactly the explicit claim that the doctrine of ""Bush kept us safe"" has always avoided that the period of time during which Bush kept us safe includes 9/11 itself. Pre-Jeb, nobody made the argument in that way, because it's obviously ridiculous. Instead, kept-us-safe-ism has tended to indulge in the fantasy that Bush was inaugurated in mid-September 2001 rather than early late January. Through this metaphysical sleight of hand, the events of 9/11 themselves neither refute nor bolster the notion that the Bush years were a time of safety. With his clumsy effort to parry Trump, however, Jeb has given away the whole game. After all, ""we"" clearly were not safe on 9/11."|2022-09-16 21:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Global Insight|307477|26307|458|6694|Russia|English|2022-09-09 16:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|1346400|723600|1284|7.633333333333334
1680|Poll finds Ben Carson knocks Donald Trump from top spot nationally|"For the first time in months, a national poll shows Donald Trump is not leading the Republican 2016 primary race, and instead has Ben Carson in first place. Carson won the support of 26% of Republican primary voters, compared to 22% who are backing Trump, according to CBS News/New York Times . Though within the poll's margin of error, it marks the first time since the billionaire businessman's dominant rise over the summer where he has been bumped from the top spot nationally. The new numbers also represent a reversal from the last CBS /New York Times poll, taken more than a month ago, which saw Trump leading Carson 27%-23%. Carson and Trump have been running consistently neck-and-neck since the start of September -- with other candidates struggling to keep pace. The switch in the lead comes as Carson has taken a clear lead in the Iowa race, beating Trump in some polls by double-digits. Trump told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Tuesday morning ""I don't get it."" CBS/New York Times pollsters found Carson outpacing Trump among women and evangelicals and running even with him among men. Trump performed better with moderate Republicans and voters without college degrees. No other candidate cracked double-digit support in the latest poll. Marco Rubio won 8% support, Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina tied for fourth place with 7 percent and Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and John Kasich each got 4%. The poll does carry an important caveat, however: 70% of respondents said they had not settled on a choice yet. Trump's supporters, however, are more locked in with their support. The most recent CBS/New York Times poll surveyed 575 Republican primary voters and carries a 6-percentage-point margin of error.

1683|Marco Rubio: Donald Trump's plan 'borders on the absurd'|"But he rejects the idea that Clinton's campaign -- which many believe has been on a hot streak lately following an appearance on ""Saturday Night Live,"" a well-received debate performance and Vice President Joe Biden's decision to not seek the White House -- ended the week on a high note following her lengthy testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. ""People may think she had a good week,"" Rubio told CNN's Jamie Gangel in an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union."" ""I think this is the week it was proven that she lied about Benghazi."" The Florida senator said he believes Clinton will be the Democratic nominee, thanks in part to her belonging to a ""political dynasty"" that will help her fundraising. As for Donald Trump, the party's current front-runner, Rubio charged the developer's immigration proposals ""border on the absurd."" ""His rhetoric is a little louder but, if you think about where he was six months ago, his position on immigration six months ago was nothing like what he's saying now. And even what he's saying now borders on the absurd,"" he said. ""He's going to deport all these people and then he's going to allow back in the ones that are good. His plan makes no sense."" Overall, Trump has failed to communicate a clear, deep understanding of America's most pressing issues, Rubio said. ""I would say that ultimately the next president of the United States, on their first day in office, must understand the threats that face this country and must have shown good judgment about what to do about those issues,"" he said. And despite Trump's current success, Rubio is confident that the former reality television star's popularity will wane. ""I'm going to support the Republican nominee, and I'm comfortable that it's not going to be Donald Trump, and I'm increasingly confident that it's going to be me,"" he said. Confidence and optimism aside, Rubio isn't blind to his low presidential poll numbers -- even in his home state -- and blames them on ""a very unusual year."" ""If you start paying attention to these polls in October, I mean, you'll go crazy. I've been up, I've been down,"" he said. ""It's a very unusual year, and I think part of it is that people are really angry about the direction of our country."|2022-09-16 11:00:00|REAL|William Kumar|Newsflash|641528|34231|423|8507|Tanzania|English|2022-09-10 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1310400|766800|2259|7.05

1704|Clinton charities reportedly will refile tax returns due to foreign donation reporting errors|Charities with ties to Hillary Clinton will re-file at least five tax returns after errors in how donations from foreign governments were disclosed, according to a published report. Reuters reported early Thursday that the errors on form 990s include under-reporting or over-reporting by millions of dollars the amounts donated by foreign governments, as well as not disclosing the donations as separate from total revenue. Reuters also reported that officials may audit other returns filed by the Clinton Foundation as far back as 15 years ago in the event of more errors being found. The report will likely add a new layer of scrutiny to the foundation, which has been criticized by Republicans and ethics experts for its ongoing ties to several foreign governments during the early stages of Hillary Clinton's run for the 2016 Democratic nomination. According to Reuters, the discrepancies are not evidence of wrongdoing in and of themselves, but they do undermine the 990s purpose of holding charities accountable for their funding and expenditures. For example, between 2010 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation claimed on tax forms that it had not received any money from either the U.S. or foreign governments. In fact, several foreign governments gave the foundation tens of millions of dollars, which was noted on the foundation's updating donor list. In addition, Reuters reports the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) will re-file its Form 990s for 2012 and 2013 after failing to note government grants in a separate section from total revenue. CHAI had previously re-filed returns from 2010 and 2011 for over-reporting the amount received in government grants by over $100 million. Hillary Clinton resigned from the Clinton Foundation's board earlier this month ahead of announcing her presidential candidacy, though her husband and daughter both remain directors.

The IAFF is one of the most influential labor groups in the U.S. Biden is especially close to labor, which could be a key constituency for him if he seeks the White House.

1741|Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders = lecture vs. rock concert|That's one way to quickly characterize the difference between a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. When Democrats visit political events for these two presidential candidates, it's a markedly different experience. For months, crowds have been a central part of the Sanders strategy, a critical ingredient in how he has overtaken Clinton in early New Hampshire polls, come within striking distance in Iowa, and has raised nearly as much money. The idea behind the big rallies -- in college towns and elsewhere across the country -- was hatched by his small team of advisers to elevate Sanders, surrounding him with tens of thousands of people. For Clinton, the calculation has been different. Democrats have already seen her on the big stage, so the decision was made to intentionally make her events small, so she could build a more direction connection with voters. She holds far more holds far more question-and-answer sessions with voters than big speeches, allowing her to demonstrate her wide-ranging knowledge and readiness to be president. But lost along the way has been some of the outward enthusiasm for her candidacy. Crowds can be like campaign yard signs: Reading too much into the size is fraught with peril. The only number that counts, of course, is on Election Day. But until then, Sanders is filling the stadiums.|2022-09-16 17:00:00|REAL|Ella Sharma|Morning Star|869803|99912|93|3210|Ukraine|English|2022-09-15 09:00:00|Carta al editor|0|True|1216800|1332000|1350|1.55

1758|Trump vows to win: 'I'm not going anywhere'|"I'm not going anywhere, I'm leading every poll and I'm going to make our country great again,"" Trump told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" on Tuesday morning. ""I'm not getting out. I'm going to win, OK?"" Trump added. ""The answer is: I'm going all the way and I'm going to win."" Trump said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he would get out of the race if his poll numbers plummeted and he had no chance of winning, setting off speculation among pundits that Trump might soon drop out of the GOP presidential contest. Trump remains the leading contender for the GOP nomination in all the major polls, but that lead has slipped in recent weeks as contenders like retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina gain on the billionaire candidate. The latest poll in Iowa from NBC News/Wall Street Journal shows Trump leading Carson by just 5 points, down from a double-digit lead just weeks ago. And in New Hampshire, Trump's lead has also slipped to 5 points ahead of Fiorina -- down from 10 points just two weeks ago. Trump also took the opportunity Tuesday to once again slam Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, as a ""total lightweight"" and even knocked Rubio for past financial difficulties: ""Take a look at his past, he's got $12 in the bank."" ""Rubio is not the guy that's going to be negotiating with the kinds of people you have to negotiate with to turn this country around,"" Trump said. RELATED: First on CNN: Trump sent prank care package to Rubio Trump has been jabbing at the Rubio campaign in recent weeks, as the Florida senator got positive reviews for his debate performance last month and has risen in the polls. His campaign sent a case of ""Trump Ice Natural Spring Water"" to Rubio's headquarters, a dig at the time Floridian who once took a memorable gulp from a water bottle while giving the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. Later on Tuesday, the Republican also defended his support for eminent domain, which allows government to seize private land and pays the owners in return. Some conservatives, such as the influential Club for Growth, which is attacking Trump for his position , oppose the power in order to protect property rights. ""Eminent domain -- when it comes to jobs, roads, the public good -- I think it's a wonderful thing,"" Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier.

1829|Clinton Picks Up The First Major Labor Endorsement Of 2016|"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton picked up an early if not surprising endorsement on Saturday from one of the country's largest labor unions: the American Federation of Teachers. The executive council of the 1.6-million member AFT voted ""overwhelmingly"" in favor of backing the early frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, according to an announcement from the union. It marks the first endorsement from a major national labor union during the 2016 presidential campaign. ""Hillary Clinton is a tested leader who shares our values, is supported by our members, and is prepared for a tough fight on behalf of students, families and communities,"" Randi Weingarten, the union's president, said in the statement. Weingarten and Clinton have been personal friends for years and the union threw its weight behind the Democrat during her 2008 campaign as well. In the resolution declaring its endorsement, the AFT said it polled its members twice and held two town halls before deciding which primary candidate to back. The endorsement comes at a helpful time for Clinton as Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders surges in polls. Still considered a long shot, Sanders has proven to be an attractive candidate to progressives in the labor movement, particularly those turned off by Clinton's unclear positions on President Barack Obama's looming trade deal. A number of local labor federations are flirting with the idea of getting behind Sanders, Politico reported. Clinton joined one of the AFT's executive council meetings last month, where she said teachers had become unfair targets of political attacks, according to the union. ""It is just dead wrong to make teachers the scapegoats for all of society's problems,"" Clinton had said. ""Where I come from, teachers are the solution. And I strongly believe that unions are part of the solution, too."" Clinton plans to meet with officials from the AFL-CIO labor federation later this month to address their concerns with her unclear stance on the White House's trade pact, Reuters reported Thursday. The AFL-CIO vehemently opposed giving the president so-called fast-track authorization for the deal, though Congress ultimately granted it in June."|2022-09-27 17:00:00|REAL|Chloe Nguyen|Insider Insights|298238|81425|346|9551|India|English|2022-09-23 02:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|1882800|2282400|2192|5.766666666666667

1883|Pro-Obama super PAC shifts focus to possible Clinton 2016 bid|"The country's biggest liberal super PAC, which helped re-elect President Obama last year, is shifting focus to support a possible Hillary Clinton White House bid in 2016. A spokesman for Priorities USA Action, originally formed by ex-Obama advisers, confirmed to FoxNews.com that it is now raising money in support of Clinton. There have been sporadic efforts by Democratic groups to encourage Clinton -- who has not yet revealed her 2016 plans -- to run, but this would mark one of the earliest and highest-profile efforts to date to raise money for someone who, at this point, is not a candidate. To coincide with the shift in focus, the group has appointed new leaders, including ex-Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. The group also will be co-chaired by former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who has called for Clinton to run in 2016. ""We couldn't be more proud and excited to be joined by Jim Messina and Governor Granholm, whose leadership and political acumen will be invaluable in our effort to elect a Democratic president in 2016,"" Priorities USA Action Executive Director Buffy Wicks said in a written statement. The New York Times first reported the shift. According to the report, Priorities USA is seeking six-and-seven-figure donations to fuel pro-Clinton ads and more. ""I think the numbers clearly show that she's the strongest presidential candidate on the Democratic side,"" Messina told the Times. ""And Priorities is going to be there for her if she decides to run."|2022-09-19 23:00:00|REAL|Xavier Chang|Capital Gazette|344520|30829|195|8547|Nigeria|English|2022-09-15 05:00:00|Columna|1|True|1612800|1202400|1486|3.25

1896|Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina Announces She's Running For President|"Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, says she will seek the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential contest. Fiorina made the announcement on ABC's Good Morning America and later via a simple tweet. Fiorina joins an already crowded field of Republicans vying for the presidency. On Sunday, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson announced his campaign. The New York Times reports that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is expected to join the fray on Tuesday. Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have all already announced their candidacies. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is still exploring a run. ""A former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, Ms. Fiorina is the second woman to make a run for the White House in this election cycle, following Hillary Rodham Clinton's announcement last month. Ms. Fiorina brings strong business acumen and a promise to be a more compassionate version of Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee. And she has suggested that she is the perfect antidote to Mrs. Clinton, who many believe has an easy path to the Democratic nomination. "" 'I think that if Hillary Clinton were to face a female nominee, there are a whole set of things she won't be able to talk about,' Ms. Fiorina said at a breakfast in Washington last month.""

1899|Carly Fiorina says ‘higher than 90 percent’ chance she’ll run for GOP presidential nomination|Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, said her chances of running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 are very high. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, the 2010 Senate candidate said she is higher than 90 percent likely to enter the race, with an announcement coming in late April or early May. Fiorina said she could appeal to voters with a deep understanding of how the economy actually works, having started as a secretary and become the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world. She added that she has relationships with many of the world leaders on the stage today and that she understands executive decision-making, as well as how to change large bureaucracies for the better. Discussing the economy, Fiorina said the government has tangled people up from a web of dependence from which they escape. She also said the government is crushing small businesses now. In a nod to the populist, anti-Wall Street themes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Fiorina said big banks are thriving while community banks go out of business. If we want mainstream and the middle class going and growing again, got to get small and family-owned businesses going and growing again, she said. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Fiorina was a 2010 California gubernatorial candidate. She actually ran as a U.S. Senate candidate that year.

1908|Ted Cruz: Democratic Party home to 'liberal fascism' against Christians|"Sen. Ted Cruz argued Saturday that Democrats have become so extreme and ""intolerant"" of religious views that ""there is no room for Christians in today's Democratic Party."" ""There is a liberal fascism that is dedicated to going after believing Christians who follow the biblical teaching on marriage,"" the Texas Republican said in his speech before a Christian conservative audience in Waukee, Iowa. Cruz joined eight other presidential candidates and potential contenders on stage at the Iowa Faith and Freedom summit, where speakers railed against what they see as threats to religious liberty. For his part, Cruz alluded to business that faced pushback for declining to cater to same-sex weddings. Many of the speakers also pointed to the recent debate over an Indiana religious liberty law that was designed to protect those who objected to participating in same-sex marriage ceremonies. But the law came under fire from critics who said it was discriminatory against same-sex couples, and its language was subsequently tweaked. As the Supreme Court gets ready to hear oral arguments on whether to overturn same-sex marriage bans in states, Cruz introduced legislation last week that would protect bans in place. Cruz urged the audience to ""fall on our knees and pray"" ahead of the Supreme Court's final ruling on the issue, which is expected this summer. ""We need leaders who will stand unapologetically in defense of marriage,"" he said."|2022-10-08 13:00:00|REAL|Lucas Kim|The Observer|1314|54737|17|8877|Turkey|English|2022-10-03 06:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|2761200|3218400|1441|0.2833333333333333

1924|Hillary Clinton Responds To Email Controversy: 'I Want The Public To See My Email'|"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton responded to intense scrutiny over her email practices on Wednesday, saying she has asked the State Department to make available her private email during her tenure as secretary of state. ""I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,"" Clinton wrote in a tweet posted late Wednesday evening. A New York Times report published Monday evening set off a firestorm of criticism, and suggested Clinton violated State Department regulations by using a personal email account for government business, potentially shielding her correspondence from public inquiries like Freedom of Information Act requests. Her email account,  was hosted by a server located at her home, and reportedly ""became a symbol of status within the inner circle."" Clinton's advisers submitted some 50,000 pages of emails to the State Department two months ago at the government's request, but critics maintained that using private email allowed Clinton to pick and choose which documents to submit with no way to verify the process. A House panel investigating the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on Wednesday issued a subpoena for any and all of Clinton's private emails related to the attack. The controversy threatens to derail Clinton's likely presidential campaign launch, reportedly planned for this month or next. Her way of addressing growing controversy -- in a tweet nearly 48 hours after it was first reported -- is likely to add to concerns over whether she is prepared to run a presidential campaign in today's hyper-media atmosphere. UPDATE: March 5, 8:45 a.m. -- The State Department said Thursday it would ""take some time"" to complete a review of the emails provided by Clinton. ""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases. We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete,"" department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement."|2022-10-07 12:00:00|REAL|Victoria Singh|Frontline Times|127958|46914|93|9973|Kenya|English|2022-09-10 10:00:00|Columna de humor|0|True|3128400|788400|2146|1.55

1959|"Poll: Ted Cruz's Support Surges After Campaign Launch | RealClearPolitics"|Being the first Republican to officially declare his campaign for president has given Ted Cruz a boost, according to a new poll. The Texas senator came in third place among nine presidential contenders with 16 percent support, according to a survey from Public Policy Polling (D). In a similar poll near the end of February, Cruz was near the bottom with just 5 percent support. The top of the poll was similar to a month ago, with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker leading the way with 20 percent backing from Republican primary voters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is second with 17 percent and Cruz now close behind. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are tied with 10 percent a significant drop for Carson, who was in second place with 18 percent in the February poll. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio both had 6 percent support, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry rounded out the field with 4 and 3 percent, respectively. sizable jump in the poll is likely attributable to his March 23 speech at Liberty University, where he officially announced his candidacy for the White House. The first-term senator is well known for his opposition to the Affordable Care Act and leading the effort to shut down the government over the health care law in 2013. It will be clear in a few weeks whether other candidates see similar jumps after their announcements. Paul is expected to declare his bid next week, and Rubio has an April 13 date booked for an announcement. quick rise and decline follow a pattern similar to what happened during the 2012 Republican primary cycle, according to Public Policy Polling President Dean Debnam. A couple of months ago Ben Carson was the hot thing in the field, now Ted Cruz is and support is drying up, Debnam said. very reminiscent of the boom and bust we saw with various candidates four years ago. And Jeb Bush remaining steady as others rise and fall is also similar to how things went for Mitt Romney went that cycle. The poll of 443 Republican primary voters, conducted March 26-31, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.|2022-09-22 21:00:00|REAL|Lucas Kim|City Times|860865|16007|297|8949|Mexico|English|2022-09-13 13:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|1058400|1864800|2157|4.95

2005|Mitt Romney Fans Speculation Over Another White House Run|"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run. The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question. This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens."" Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,"" answer in January. If he does throw his hat into the ring for a third time, the former governor of Massachusetts told the Times that he would employ a cameraman -- essentially his own tracker -- to follow him around in order to guard against statements that derailed his 2012 campaign. ""I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff,"" Romney said. Romney said the tactic could potentially prevent another ""47 percent"" incident, which by his telling, was nothing more than a problem of setting. ""My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,"" Romney said. ""If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man."|2022-10-08 23:00:00|REAL|William Kumar|Daily Digest|134434|3352|385|9743|South Africa|English|2022-09-30 23:00:00|Crónica|0|True|2563200|3254400|1570|6.416666666666667

But Clinton told Walters an official announcement was premature. ""It's such a difficult decision, and it's one that I'm not going to rush into ... and I don't think we should be looking at the next election,"" Clinton said. ""I think we should be looking at the work that we have today. Our unemployment rate is too high. We have people getting kicked off food stamps who are in terrible economic straits. Small business is not getting credit, I could go on and on, so I think we ought to pay attention to what's happening right now."" Clinton told Walters that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has said he wants her ""to do what I think is right,"" prompting Walters to ask what America would call him if she were to win.

2037|IT BEGINS...|"And they are looking for someone who could appeal to - or at least not offend - Hispanics, non-white women and other parts of the electorate that went big for Obama and Democrats last year. That's why, just four months into Obama's second term, Paul is part of a stampede of Republican would-be contenders who are criss-crossing the country meeting voters, recruiting potential donors and currying favor with local politicians who could help determine their fate in a run for the White House. The lessons of Romney's bitter loss in November are never far away. On Monday, Paul made jokes about neighboring (and more liberal) Massachusetts and chided leading Democrat Hillary Clinton. But the Kentucky senator also made a point of calling for a more diverse Republican Party, one that, in his words, should have room for tattooed, bearded and pony-tailed voters. Rubio's fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, the state's former governor and a brother to one former president and son to another, has not indicated whether he might run in 2016. But he has been politically active, calling for Congress to approve an immigration bill. The lack of an obvious front-runner for the upcoming presidential election is not unusual for the Democratic Party but is for Republicans, who for generations have typically had an experienced contender in line to run for the White House. ""We are putting together a narrative of the Rick Santorum story,"" Brabender said. ""It's pretty interesting to see how close he came to the (2012) nomination.

2044|Gov. Jindal 'thinking and praying' about 2016 run - Politics.com|"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said on Monday he was ""thinking and praying"" about a presidential run and said that an announcement could follow the midterm elections or ""sometime after the holidays."" If he decides to run, Jindal would likely be the first Republican candidate to announce his decision. Most potential challengers have said they are waiting until spring 2015. In his speech, Jindal tried to rouse hawks in the party by harshly criticizing President Barack Obama. ""The Russian reset, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Iran, Libya, Europe, China, and the list goes on. In each of these areas, it's not just the President took too long to come up with an answer. It's that the answer was wrong,"" he said at an American Enterprise Institute event. Jindal called Obama's cutting back on defense spending ""foolish"" and ""unacceptable"" at a time when the administration has considered intervening in several foreign conflicts. The two-term governor went on to say that the U.S. is at war with ISIS and that the President's hesitancy to call it a fight is ""a projection of weakness."" He also slammed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, for making decisions the he believes has set America on a path for ""more chaos, more conflict and more wars."" ""Today, we are living with the consequences of the Obama-Clinton ideas when it comes to foreign, domestic and defense policy... If only it had the help of a wise, steady hand, a policy expert in dealing with foreign affairs, he'd have come up with better answers. But instead he just had Hillary Clinton,"" he said. In a set of policy proposals, Jindal suggested that defense spending should be 4% of the country's GDP. He also called for increasing the Pentagon's funding, following the administration's decision to cut back $78 billion in 2011 as a way to decrease the deficit. In the interim before potentially launching his campaign, Jindal hopes to see the Republican Party take the initiative rather than being known as the opposition party. Jindal mentioned that several Republican members have sided with Obama in the past, including on defense spending cutbacks. ""[The people] are frustrated with the President, but they have yet to hear a comprehensive alternative from the Republicans. All they heard so far is that we are opposed to many of his policies,"" he said. ""What they are hungry for is a positive agenda from the Republican side."|2022-10-07 22:00:00|REAL|Olivia Kumar|Morning Star|238025|57568|18|276|Pakistan|English|2022-09-04 21:00:00|Reportaje especial|1|True|309600|3164400|2451|0.3

During a town hall event in New Hampshire, Bush said he thinks religion ""ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm."" I hope not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope, Bush said, according to the New York Times.

2109|It’s official: California farmers volunteer to give up water|"drought has touched everyone in the state. First the government eliminated irrigation water deliveries through much of the public canal system. Then the governor told cities and industry to cut back water use by 25 percent. Now the state is taking a step it resorted to since 1977: claiming water from people with old riparian water rights. These are people who have been drawing water from rivers since the Gold Rush era, and who are generally immune to cuts. But in the most severe shortages, the state can order them to stop pumping. When Governor Jerry Brown ordered cities to conserve water, many people were disappointed that he did not set a similar mandate for ag. Of course, the state had already turned off the tap for many farmers. And now making further cuts, going after senior water-rights holders this time. To protect some of this water, farmers in the Joaquin Delta volunteered to cut their water use 25 percent from 2013 levels if the state would promise not to mandate deeper cuts in the growing season. About 10 percent of irrigated farmland is in the delta; today, the state announced it would take the deal. Other cuts are virtually inevitable for farmers who participate, said Felicia Marcus, chair of the state Water Resources Control Board. Those cuts could come next week, unless rain and cool weather allows for delay. Further cuts will go beyond any that have ever happened before: ""Senior [water rights] holders have never been cut as much as they will be this year,"" Marcus said. ""Lawsuits are inevitable."" The restrictions may be hard to enforce because California simply measure water use in some places. the Associated Press: However, state officials said they would use satellite and aerial photography to ensure that farmers were letting their fields go dry. Cheating is expensive if you get caught. Violators can be fined $10,000 a day. Most Californians support the cuts to urban water use and think the cuts to ag cause real hardship to the general population, according to a Field Poll.

But in Washington, she's found herself the target of numerous attacks from conservatives. ""For me, the environment has never been a partisan issue,"" McCarthy told The Huffington Post. ""I deal with science and facts. And I try to make the most reasonable decisions I can, so that the environment can be recognized as really part and parcel of the foundation of a growing economy."" ""I have never had any difficulty working for either a Republican or a Democrat, as long as they allow me to do my job, as long as we can keep politics out of it and real policy involvement in it,"" she said. ""I think that we do a pretty good job here at EPA in trying to stay out of the politics and stay in our lane, which is to really speak for the American public and protect their right to clean air and clean water and healthy land.""

2124|California slashes water use for upstate farmers|"State officials announced major water cutbacks for Northern California farmers Friday, a historic step that could challenge claims the agriculture industry is getting a free pass during the state's epic drought. The cutbacks will affect some of California's oldest water rights holders farmers who laid claim to surface water more than a century ago for the first time in four decades. They will not be allowed to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet. State officials said the rivers simply don't have enough water to meet the demands of all rights holders. This isn't the first time during the current drought that state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already ""curtailed"" nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them ""junior"" water rights that were established post-1914. But for the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell ""senior"" water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there just isn't enough water for them. The cutbacks announced Friday impact rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914. And more historic cuts could be coming over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board said Friday that it's continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be on the horizon for even more senior rights holders. ""Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,"" the water board said in a statement. State officials said in a conference call that the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much. The water board has indicated in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.

The administration plans to propose designating the area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, the highest level of federal protection that would ban oil and gas drilling, the newspaper reported, citing people briefed on the plan. The move is certain to spark yet another fight with Republicans, who have fought for 35 years over how to manage what is known as ANWR, or the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The vast region has huge petroleum reserves but also provides critical habitat for caribou, millions of migrating birds, polar bears and other wildlife. coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive,"" said the new Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairman, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a statement to the Post. clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska. But we will not be run over like this. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal."" The state's Republican congressional delegation, along with the new governor, Bill Walker, sent out a joint news release Sunday morning calling the action ""an unprecedented assault on Alaska."" Walker, an independent, said in a statement that he may be forced to accelerate oil and gas permitting on state lands to compensate for the new federal restrictions. ""Having just given to Alaskans the State of the State and State of the Budget addresses, clear that our fiscal challenges in both the short and long term would benefit significantly from increased oil production,"" Walker said. Roughly 40 billion barrels of the untapped reserves are already in federal areas where oil and gas activity is blocked or restricted, he pointed out. The announcement, which could come on Sunday, is likely the first in a series of decisions the administration will make in the coming week about Alaska's oil and gas production.

2148|Earth had warmest winter on record|The Earth just had its warmest winter on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Winter is defined as the months of December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere, and 90% of the world's population lives in the Northern Hemisphere. Those months are summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Specifically, the Northern Hemisphere had its warmest winter on record, and the Southern Hemisphere had its fourth-warmest summer. It's also the warmest year-to-date on record, NOAA said. February itself was the second-warmest February on record. Temperatures for beat the previous winter record in 2007 by 0.05 degrees, NOAA's National Climatic Data Center reported. Global temperature records go back to 1880. One of the planet's only land areas that had a cooler-than-average winter was eastern North America, which includes the eastern United States and eastern Canada. Areas that saw record warmth those three months include the western U.S. and part of central Siberia and eastern Mongolia. A separate global temperature measurement from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, released Tuesday, said it was the second-warmest winter on record for those three months. Some of the warmer-than-average temperatures over the winter are because of a nascent El Niño a climate pattern when warm sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific influence weather around the world. The warming effects El Niño increase the chances that this year could end up being the warmest on record beating out the 2014 record.|2022-10-09 19:00:00|REAL|Benjamin Singh|Global Gazette|490299|78807|80|498|DR Congo|English|2022-09-24 09:00:00|Entrevista|0|True|1994400|3326400|1545|1.3333333333333333
2151|Report: Solar industry added jobs 20 times faster than the national average last year|A new report from the Solar Foundation has found that the solar industry added jobs almost 20 times faster than the national average last year, adding over 31,000 jobs in the sector between Nov. 2013 and Nov. 2014. In the last five years, the number of people employed in the solar industry also grew by 87 percent, from 93,000 jobs to 173,807. Almost 90 percent of jobs added in the sector were in installation, meaning that more and more Americans are opting for the power source, thanks to falling prices and various financing options. That has made it a no-brainer for a lot of people to go solar, said Andrea Luecke, executive director of the Solar Foundation, in an interview with the Washington Post. If you can get solar installed on your roof for zero down and pay less than what currently paying your utility and not have to worry about maintenance, a pretty easy sell. According to the report, the solar installation sector beat out the oil and gas pipeline construction industry and the crude oil and natural gas extraction industry in 2014, creating almost 50 percent more jobs than those industries did. The report also expects solar jobs to continue to grow in 2015, predicting that more than 36,000 jobs will be added over the next 12 months. Overall, the report found that one out of every 78 jobs created in the U.S. last year were related to solar. Still, the boom may not last growing efficiency means that the industry expects a slowdown in growth in 2017. Solar power is a key component of our all-of-the-above approach to American energy, creating good-paying American jobs that support our growing clean energy economy, said Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz in a statement. This diverse and vibrant workforce is vital to achieving the goal of doubling electricity generation from renewable sources yet again by 2020.|2022-09-21 12:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Morning Star|39445|19690|359|4724|Myanmar|English|2022-09-13 06:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1746000|1033200|1837|5.983333333333333

2159|Senate Democrats block swift passage of Keystone XL pipeline bill (+video)|"Senate supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport crude oil from a private Canadian company to Texas oil refineries, failed to get the 60 votes needed to limit debate on the controversial project. Senate Democrats blocked a GOP bill to push the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project through Congress. The pipeline would transport oil from a private Canadian company to Texas refineries, via public and private lands up and down the US. Democrats in the U.S. Senate blocked the Keystone XL pipeline bill from moving forward on Monday, but supporters of the project vowed to push ahead and eventually get a vote on the measure. The Senate failed to get the 60 votes needed to limit debate, voting 53 to 39 on the measure. The Keystone bill allows Congress to approve TransCanada Corp's project to link Canada's oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Democrats, who lost control of the Senate as a result of November's elections, flexed their muscles to deliver a message to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he will have to deal with them even on bills that enjoy some bipartisan support. McConnell has pledged that amendments to bills will be debated in an open process. But Democrats said McConnell cut off debate last Thursday on several amendments. ""He's got to work with us and not try to jam us,"" Senator Chuck Schumer said of McConnell. Democrats are not trying to delay the bill, but they don't want McConnell to shut down the open process at his whim, said Schumer, the Senate's third ranking Democrat. Republicans have made passing the Keystone bill the first priority of the new Senate. But the White House has said President Barack Obama would reject the bill, and Keystone supporters are four votes short of the 67 needed to overcome any veto. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chairman of the energy committee, vowed to work with Democrats on her panel to consider additional amendments."|2022-10-10 19:00:00|REAL|Victoria Singh|City Beat|208873|60665|167|2628|Turkey|English|2022-09-13 02:00:00|Reseña|1|True|1018800|3412800|1924|2.783333333333333

2173|Trump's unreal foreign policy: Our view|"As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertaining, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous. Which is a good place to start with the much-awaited foreign policy speech delivered Wednesday in Washington by presidential candidate Donald Trump. As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, the Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain class of people. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to trade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments, and wistful for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world. In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does not exist: allies would be more respectful after being lectured to, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through U.S. disengagement. Inexplicably, Trump declared that America First would be the overarching theme of his administration. A non-interventionist approach might have its merits in certain situations. But the America First movement got its name espousing an isolationist approach at exactly the wrong moment, urging the United States to stay out of World War II as Adolf Hitler was rampaging through Europe. Trump's secondary audience was the Washington establishment, the equivalent of TV critics. And the early reviews were harsh. On CNN, foreign policy experts Fareed Zakaria and David Rothkopf used the same word: incoherent. Fellow Republican Lindsey Graham tweeted, Not sure who is advising Trump on foreign policy, but I can understand why not revealing their names. In worldview, things happen because he says they will. He made a number of proclamations to this effect. His unspecified plan to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group echoed Richard Nixon's secret plan in 1968 to win the Vietnam War. ISIL will be gone if elected president,"" Trump vowed, "" And they'll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly. Things might happen that way on TV. But not in reality. Or perhaps we should say real reality. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

218|Speaker Paul Ryan: Let's live in the Christmas spirit|On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Christmas this year. We spend a lot of time this season asking for what we want. But perhaps it would be better to ask for what we need. We have been given so much in this country that it almost seems ungrateful to ask for more. But all of all more of what is good. And this year, I hope that all of us continue to live in what I consider the spirit of Christmas: a courageous humility. It took courage for God to humble Himself. He came down from heaven and became a child in a manger. He did this while knowing that one day He would have to lay down His life for us. He would have to give up His only Son. At first, this might seem like a sad story. But we are to rejoice in the Lord always. Christmas is a day of celebration. And it is only through grace and prayer that we come to realize: what a gift given a profound act of love. And so we rejoice. This year, may we continue the spirit of Christmas by facing our flaws fearlessly and by giving back boldly. May we recognize that our way is not the only is not even the right way. It is way we seek. May we cherish all the gifts we have been the men and women of our armed forces, the people who keep us safe. And may we remember that it takes courage to put others first. It is courageous to do the right thing. May we remember, and be be glad. Republican Paul Ryan is Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. He represents Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District.

2189|Obama: Gov. Scott Walker needs to ‘bone up’ on foreign policy|"President Obama and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker traded barbs Monday after the president suggested that the likely Republican presidential candidate ""bone up on foreign policy."" Obama made the remarks in an interview with NPR published Monday, responding to a question from reporter Steve Inskeep about Walker's vow to undo a nuclear pact with Iran on his first day in the White House. In defending his administration's tentative framework with Iran over its nuclear program, Obama told NPR that he is confident that it does not need congressional approval. He added that he hopes lawmakers ""won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries. If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies."" Obama added: ""And it would be a foolish approach to take, and, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way."" Walker, who has been eager to establish his foreign policy chops ahead of a likely bid for the GOP presidential nomination next year, didn't take long to fight back with a string of Twitter messages. Walker has been overshadowed the past two weeks as a pair of rivals Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) announced their candidacies for the Republican nomination. The governor has not impressed many of the party's leaders with his knowledge of international affairs, drawing mockery last month for refusing to talk about foreign policy on a trip to London and then for comparing his experience battling labor protesters to taking on Islamic State terrorists. Obama has been eager to sell the Iran nuclear framework to a skeptical Congress as his administration seeks to finalize a deal without lawmakers approving additional sanctions on Tehran that could scuttle the talks."|2022-10-02 13:00:00|REAL|Xavier Chang|Sunrise Chronicle|793710|24697|224|2691|Tanzania|English|2022-09-10 14:00:00|Carta al editor|1|True|2700000|802800|1904|3.7333333333333334

""Do we want to continue the barrel bombing, which is one of the reasons why 240,000 Syrians have been murdered? Do we want this flood of refugees to continue?"" In the interview, McCain also prodded Republican presidential candidates to ""think about Ronald Reagan and the way he conducted his campaigns.""

2203|Obama: Battle against ISIS Could Take Decades|"President Barack Obama is proposing a new strategy in the fight against ISIS, saying the battle against the Islamic State will not be quick. In fact, he says it could take decades. During a rare visit to the Pentagon, Obama laid out his revamped strategy, saying the fight against the Islamic State will require more than just weapons. ""No amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it's matched by a broader effort, political and economic,"" he said. The president said coalition forces will go after the heart of ISIS, but he did not call for more bombing or more troops, announcing instead a shift in focus to counter the terror group's public relations tactics. Obama pointed to a string of ISIS defeats in the region due to airstrikes targeting the group's supply lines. But he said more needs to be done to recruit and train Syrians for the fight on the ground. When it comes to lone wolf terrorists in America inspired by ISIS, the president admitted they're harder to detect, saying U.S. national security must remain vigilant. Obama pointed to increased efforts to counter ISIS's propaganda that's spreading worldwide via social media. ""We also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States,"" he said. While the fight against ISIS will be long, the president said he's confident the terrorists won't win. But Republicans remain skeptical, saying Obama's plan doesn't go far enough. ""A speech isn't a strategy,"" said Cory Fritz, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""At no point in his remarks did President Obama indicate he's doing anything to change course and actually build the broad, overarching plan that's needed to take on these savage terrorists and win."" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said the president ""doesn't have a strategy.""

2213|Republicans Warn Iran Against Nuclear Deal With Obama|"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Republican senators warned Iran on Monday that any nuclear deal made with U.S. President Barack Obama could last only as long as he remains in office, in an unusual intervention into U.S. foreign policy-making. The letter, signed by 47 U.S. senators, says Congress plays a role in ratifying international agreements and points out that Obama will leave office in January 2017, while many in Congress will remain in Washington long after that. ""We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,"" the letter read. ""The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of an agreement at any time,"" it read. The letter, first reported by Bloomberg News, followed a speech to a joint meeting of Congress last week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that the United States was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Tehran. It comes as world powers have been negotiating with Iran to try to reach some form of understanding by the end of March before a final deal in June that could ease crippling sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. The U.S. Constitution divides foreign policy powers between the president and Congress. The executive branch is responsible for negotiating international agreements and lawmakers rarely intervene directly with the leaders of another nation while the president's administration is negotiating a pact. Republicans want any U.S. nuclear agreement with Iran to be approved by Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who signed the letter released on Monday, agreed to postpone a vote on a bill requiring Obama to submit any deal for congressional approval amid outcry from Democrats. Along with McConnell, Republican signers include Tom Cotton, Orrin Hatch, John Cornyn, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, John Thune and Mark Kirk. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, two possible 2016 presidential contenders, also signed.

2246|Alabama's Top Judge Faces Ethics Charges Over Gay-Marriage Order|"The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission charged Chief Justice Roy Moore, an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions, with violating the state's judicial ethics laws, an allegation that could potentially remove him from office, according to news website  The legality of gay marriage had been at the center of a national debate for years until the Supreme Court ruled in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, handing a historic triumph to the American gay rights movement. Despite the ruling and a federal court ruling that made gay marriage legal in Alabama, Moore issued in January an administrative order to state probate judges, ordering them not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents. ""Chief Justice Moore flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority,"" the complaint said. ""Moore knowingly ordered [probate judges] to commit violations...knowingly subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office."" Moore said in a statement that the commission has no authority over administrative orders or the court's ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. ""We intend to fight this agenda vigorously and expect to prevail,"" he said. Moore wrote in his order that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The conflicting opinions had resulted in ""confusion and uncertainty,"" Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so. Until the Alabama Supreme Court decides the matter, probate judges ""have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license,"" he said. The complaint said Moore's order ""was contrary to clear and determined law about which there is no confusion or unsettled question."" Moore, a Republican, has been a hero of conservative causes before. In 2003, he was removed from office after a federal judge ruled he was placing himself above the law by refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument.

2258|Watch: Obama criticizes Kenya's president on gay rights as they stand right by each other|"President Barack Obama forcefully disagreed with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on gay rights as they stood right by each other in a joint news conference on Saturday. ""With respect to the rights of gays and lesbians, I've been consistent all across Africa on this,"" Obama said. ""I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law, and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law, and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation."" Kenyatta responded later on, saying LGBTQ rights is just one of the issues that he and Obama disagree on, CNN's Kristen Holmes and Eugene Scott reported. ""Kenya and the United States, we share so many values,"" he said. ""But there are some things that we must admit we don't share our culture, our societies don't accept. It's very difficult for us to be able to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept."" A Supreme Court decision recently legalized same-sex marriages across the US. But many countries in Africa, including Kenya, still ban same-sex relations altogether. Other countries punish same-sex relations with the death penalty. Here's a thorough breakdown of national laws from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, which is now slightly outdated since it's missing the Supreme Court decision affirming marriage equality in the US (click to enlarge): So while the US is making great strides on LGBTQ rights, much of the rest of the world lags far behind sometimes dangerously so for LGBTQ people."|2022-09-14 02:00:00|REAL|Lucas Kim|The Insight|198377|25396|336|6416|Germany|English|2022-09-07 05:00:00|Reseña|0|True|511200|1105200|1565|5.6

And I think if we did a little more of that then maybe the law have to engage in stuff really personal, and the law could be more neutral, but I think the law ought to be fair to people and ought to provide equal protection for everybody, he said. Paul was asked about Bruce Jenner coming out as a woman named Caitlyn. Social conservatives in the Republican Party have felt isolated by the acceptance of Jenner, a change they see as immoral. Paul said he hasn't given Jenner's transition much thought but said that sexuality should remain private. [Read: Caitlyn Jenner comes out, and social conservatives take an apocalyptic view] exposed so much of our lives that were at one time private, and if it were private, than maybe the law have to take a position on it, you know what I mean?

2274|Texas Bill To Add Barriers To Gay Marriage Dies In House|"AUSTIN, Texas, May 15 (Reuters) - Republican-backed legislation to put new blockades on same-sex marriage in Texas died in the statehouse on Friday after failing to win approval by a midnight deadline amid stalling tactics by the Democratic minority. The bill, called the ""Preservation of Sovereignty and Marriage Act,"" would block clerk's offices in the state's 254 counties from using tax money to issue licenses for same-sex weddings. Socially conservative backers have said the measure allows the state to exert its rights regarding marriage. The bill's demise comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide next month whether same-sex marriage will be legal nationwide. About a decade ago, voters in the largely conservative state overwhelmingly approved a Texas constitutional amendment that only allows marriage between a man and a woman. State Republican leaders have said they will fight to enforce the ban on same-sex marriage. The bi-annual Texas legislative session ends in about two weeks. All bills, except the budget, that did not pass in the Texas House of Representatives before Friday are not allowed to proceed. Before gay marriage became legal in the liberal northeastern state of Massachusetts in 2004, it was not permitted in any state. Now it is legal in 37 states and Washington.

2299|Alabama begins issuing marriage licenses to gay couples|"Alabama began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples Monday, despite an 11th-hour attempt from the state's chief justice -- an outspoken opponent -- to block the weddings. The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday morning that it wouldn't stop the marriages from beginning in the state, and shortly after, Jefferson County probate judge Alan King issued several licenses. He did so despite Chief Justice Roy Moore's Sunday night order to all probate judges, directing them to refuse to issue the licenses. One of the licenses went to Dee and Laura Bush, who have been together for seven years and have five kids between them. ""It is great that we were able to be part of history,"" said Dee Bush. After receiving her license, she and Laura walked outside to a park where a minister was performing wedding ceremonies to cheers from crowds. By issuing licenses, King says he was abiding by the federal court order from January that determined Alabama's statutory and constitutional bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Callie Granade had put her order on hold until Monday to let the state prepare for the change. The state attorney general has requested that the hold be extended, but the U.S. Supreme Court refused to do so. Moore's order to probate judges was a dramatic return to defiance for the chief justice. He was removed from the post in 2003 for refusing to obey a federal court order to remove a washing machine-sized Ten Commandments from the state judicial building. Critics lashed out that Moore had no authority to tell county probate judges to enforce a law that a federal judge already ruled unconstitutional. He's been one of the state's most outspoken critics of gay marriage; in 2002 he called homosexuality an ""evil"" in a custody ruling. ""This is a pathetic, last-ditch attempt at judicial fiat by an Alabama Supreme Court justice--a man who should respect the rule of law rather than advance his personal beliefs,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign."|2022-10-05 15:00:00|REAL|Ella Sharma|Urban News|333439|65375|126|7541|Bangladesh|English|2022-09-12 00:00:00|Crónica|1|True|925200|2966400|2027|2.1

Bataillon has struck down the state's ban on gay marriage before; in 2005, the judge ruled the ban unconstitutional, but the Eight Circuit reversed his decision in July 2006.

2316|Alabama Lawmaker: Same-Sex Couples Don’t Deserve Same Financial Benefits As Other Families|Most conservatives who oppose marriage equality will cite the Bible, nature, or polygamy and incest to justify their opposition. But for one Alabama state senator, a reason to oppose marriage equality is that it would allow same-sex couples to receive the same financial benefits that different-sex couples currently receive. You gotta look at the financial aspect of this as well, State Sen. Del Marsh (R) told radio host Dale Jackson last week. face it. If gay marriage is approved, I assume that those types of unions, those people would be entitled to Social Security benefits, insurance. Where does it end? Contrary to claim that the financial impact of marriage equality would be devastating, studies have shown that it would be a boon for the economy. Indeed, in 2004 the Congressional Budget Office weighed the potential increased spending on Social Security and other benefits against the increased savings from other programs like Medicare and Medicaid. They found that if all states were to legalize marriage equality, it would boost the federal budget by $10 billion over 10 years. Other reports have found that legalizing marriage equality would improve state budgets as well. The Williams Institute estimates that marriage equality would add $21.7 million to economy over the first three years. opponents of marriage equality were left scrambling after a judge ruled two weeks ago that the ban on same-sex marriage violated both Equality Protection and Due Process protections. The decision is temporarily stayed, pending appeal. It is set to take effect on February 9th. Marsh was first elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1998.

Huckabee, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, reiterated Sunday that he would like to run for the Republican nomination, joking that his ideal scenario would be for all other GOP candidates to drop out of the primary and let him win. He said his opposition to gay marriage is no more conservative than President Barack Obama's was when he won his first presidential term. ""Obama had the same position I had when he spoke about it in 2008, and for the same reason,"" Huckabee said. ""He said it was because he was a Christian and because God is in the mix."" Obama's views on the subject have since evolved, and he said in 2012 that he supports same-sex marriage. Republicans, particularly younger ones, have also been warming to the idea of gay marriage.

If the White House really wants to crack down on gun violence -- maybe they should enforce the laws that are already on the books. But that's not the point.

Just after the Muslim terrorist attack in San Bernardino the Washington Post found that 53 percent of voters oppose a ban on assault weapons -- a record high.

So instead of declaring war on law-abiding gun owners -- maybe the president ought to declare war on the true threat facing our nation -- radical Islam.

The comments, made during a stop in South Carolina last week, earned the president three out of four ""Pinocchios"" -- the fact-checker's scale for measuring inaccuracy. The first fact-check involved a comment Obama made -- at a town hall at South Carolina's Benedict College -- where he said, What we have to recognize is, is that our homicide rates are so much higher than other industrial countries. I mean by like a mile. The president seemed to be telling students the U.S. had the highest homicide rate in the industrialized world, which true, according to the newspaper. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average homicide rate among the 36 countries is 4.1 per 100,000 people. Brazil tops the list with a homicide rate of 25.5. The U.S. and Chile tie for fourth. Both have a homicide rate of 5.2. The president also told those attending the South Carolina event that easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable. This is just a very strange comment that appears to have no statistical basis, the Washington Post wrote. The paper added that some of its readers suggested Obama was talking about the U.S. Department of food desert locator, which identifies areas in the country where fresh vegetables are hard to buy. The columnist acknowledged that some of the analysis in the fact-check ""turns on what the listener believes the president was trying to say."" Finally, the fact-check took the president to task after he told students he was not exaggerating when he claimed lawmakers are backing plans that would allow firearms in kindergarten and machine guns in bars. While some states like Georgia allow firearms to be carried into bars and restaurants, they do not allow machine guns in bars.

2410|Here's How Many People In Each State May Not Be Able To Afford Insurance If The Supreme Court Rules Against Obamacare|The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a major new lawsuit against Obamacare this June, and the health coverage for millions hangs in the balance. This challenge to the Affordable Care Act, called King v. Burwell, came from longtime Obamacare opponents who claim that, because of a key phrase in the law, the federal government may provide tax credit subsidies only in states that operate their own health insurance exchanges. Thirty-four states declined to establish these marketplaces, and instead left that responsibility in the hands of the federal government. If the Supreme Court rules for the plaintiffs in this case, it would eliminate health insurance subsidies for 7.5 million low- and moderate-income people in those states, causing most of them to become uninsured when their premiums become unaffordable without financial assistance. Here's how the numbers break down in each state with a federally operated health insurance exchange. Infographic by Alissa Scheller for The Huffington Post. Jonathan Cohn and Jesse Rifkin contributed reporting. UPDATE: June 4 -- The numbers displayed on this map are derived from a report that counted health insurance exchange enrollment as of Feb. 22, which the Department of Health and Human Services published on March 10. The department released new data on June 2, detailing enrollment as of March 31. According to the new report, 7.3 million people were covered by plans purchased via the federally operated health insurance exchanges in the 34 states subject to the Supreme Court ruling, and 6.4 million of them received subsidies. The new report includes additional information about each state, but does not update the calculation of average unsubsidized premiums.|2022-10-01 04:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Global Insight|540680|57279|293|6384|Myanmar|English|2022-09-02 14:00:00|Columna|1|True|111600|2581200|1735|4.883333333333334

2435|House Votes To Repeal Affordable Care Act|"The House voted 239-186 today to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the latest effort by the Republican-controlled chamber to scrap the law. The measure also would direct panels to come up with a replacement for the healthcare law though it doesn't provide a timeline on any new legislation or what provisions it may contain. The House-approved measure likely will be defeated in the Senate, where the GOP has a smaller majority. President Obama has threatened to veto any legislation that rips up his signature achievement. The Associated Press notes the House has voted more than 50 times in the past two years to repeal the law. What was different about today's vote? NPR's S.V. Date writes in our It's All Politics blog: ""What makes today a milestone is that, for the first time, House Republicans plan to vote on whether to actually take health coverage away from millions of Americans who now have it."" Today's vote came after Obama met with 10 Americans that the White House said wrote the president letters about how they benefited from the law. ""It was maybe plausible to be opposed to the Affordable Care Act before it was implemented, but now it is being implemented and it is working,"" Obama said at the meeting. But as NPR's Ron Elving notes, though no one expects today's vote to kill the law, ""these issues are important to many who voted for Republican candidates in the 2014 election and expect campaign promises to be honored."|2022-09-23 15:00:00|REAL|Sophie Chen|The Insight|235872|68186|308|4718|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-06 09:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|1929600|439200|1441|5.133333333333334
2445|Obamacare Is Back At The Supreme Court, And These 6 Lives Hang In The Balance|bamacare is back before the Supreme Court in a case that could gut the health care law and leave millions of Americans facing severe consequences. King v. Burwell, a lawsuit that originated in conservative and libertarian think tanks, alleges that a stray phrase in the Affordable Care Act -- an exchange established by the state -- means the federal government allowed to provide subsidies to the residents of states that refused to establish health insurance exchanges under the law. Only 13 states and the District of Columbia have their own exchanges. If this bid to derail the Affordable Care Act succeeds, the subsidies would disappear -- maybe immediately, maybe a little later -- for Obamacare enrollees everywhere else. Behind the numbers, however, is a very human story. Without the subsidies, health insurance costs would spike beyond the means of low- and moderate-income recipients. As a result, close to 10 million people would lose their health coverage. Many others would face major increases in the premiums they pay for insurance. The Huffington Post interviewed six Americans at risk of the worst effects of a high court ruling against Obamacare. We wanted to know how the law has affected their lives already, and how the absence of subsidies might affect them in the future. They told stories of life and death, financial ruin, lifelong plans in jeopardy and families disrupted. Here are those stories, as told by the people who would be living them.|2022-09-15 20:00:00|REAL|Daniel Patel|Star Sentinel|796597|35724|379|9472|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-05 17:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|381600|1256400|1471|6.316666666666666

2455|Heart disease kills way more people than war, murder, and traffic accidents combined|"The scariest causes of death war, murder, car accidents are also some of the least common ways that we die. This fact is made abundantly clear in a graphic from Britain's National Health Service, which displays the leading causes of death in the United Kingdom: Much more mundane things, like circulatory and digestive disorders, are much more common causes of death murders or car accidents. While this data comes from the United Kingdom, the leading causes of death in the United States look pretty similar: heart disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease are the most common killers in America. ""Every day we are told of lethal new threats to our health and lives,"" the NHS writes in an explanation of the graphic. ""Food additives, knife crime, pollution, terrorism ... It's not that these threats are not potential killers, but in this blizzard of health warnings it's easy to lose perspective and worry about small or insignificant risks while ignoring, or being unaware, of major threats."" The NHS has also put together a set of ""risk"" factors that looks at some of the leading behavioral decisions that cause death, whether that's smoking too much or consuming too few fruits and vegetables: You can also use an interactive version of the Atlas of Risk, which lets you break down the risks and causes of death for different demographics. For example, that data shows that traffic accidents are a much higher cause of death for people between the ages of 1 and 19 than for other age groups. This is what that chart looks like: You can find the Atlas of Risk here.

2459|Obama Slams Staples, Big Companies On Health Care: 'Shame On Them'|"WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama singled out office supply giant Staples Inc as undercutting his healthcare reform law and said large corporations should not use the health insurance issue as an excuse for cutting wages, the news website BuzzFeed reported. ""It's one thing when you've got a mom-and-pop store who can't afford to provide paid sick leave or health insurance or minimum wage to workers but when I hear large corporations that make billions of dollars in profits trying to blame our interest in providing health insurance as an excuse for cutting back workers' wages, shame on them,"" Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed. The Affordable Care Act requires companies with more than 50 employees to pay for health insurance for people who work 30 hours a week or more. Reuters has reported that some businesses are keeping staffing numbers below 50 or cutting the work week to less than 30 hours to avoid providing employee health insurance. Staples, the No. 1 U.S. office supplies retailer, has told its employees not to work more than 25 hours per week, according to a Buzzfeed report on Monday. ""There is no reason for an employer who is not currently providing health care to their workers to discourage them from either getting health insurance on the job or being able to avail themselves of the Affordable Care Act,"" Obama said in the interview Tuesday. ""I haven't looked at Staples stock lately or what the compensation of the CEO is, but I suspect that they could well afford to treat their workers favorably and give them some basic financial security, and if they can't, then they should be willing to allow those workers to get the Affordable Care Act without cutting wages,"" Obama said. Nearly 7.5 million people have signed up for 2015 Obamacare health plans through HealthCare.gov with demand increasing as the Feb. 15 enrollment deadline approaches, according to government figures. Staples and No. 2 office retailer Office Depot Inc announced last week a $6.3 billion plan to join forces to compete against big box stores and online rivals.

2463|Nurse Chris Christie Quarantined For Ebola Goes After Governor On Vaccines|"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) came out as a vaccine choicer Tuesday, saying it should be up to parents to decide whether to inoculate their children against deadly diseases that could infect the rest of the population. His stance was looser than the one he took last year against Kaci Hickox, the nurse Christie forcibly quarantined over Ebola fears when she returned to the United States after helping patients in West Africa. There was never any evidence that Hickox had symptoms of Ebola, a far less contagious disease than the measles, which is currently spreading across the country due to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. On Monday night, Hickox went on ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on MSNBC and blasted Christie for his vaccination comments. ""I think this is a good example of Gov. Christie making some very ill-informed statements. We heard it a lot during the Ebola discussion, and now it seems to have happened again,"" said Hickox. ""We know that vaccines are safe, and we know that vaccines save lives,"" she said. ""I have worked in a measles outbreak in northern Nigeria before. We were seeing about 2,000 children a week with measles. It is a scary disease. I know that these families of these 100 people who have the disease now could tell you a little bit about what the disease looks like and how much misery it causes. After the vaccine was implemented in 1963, there was a large reduction in cases, about 98 percent. And I believe it was 1989 to '91, there was a resurgence. ... The stakes are high. We have to protect our most vulnerable populations."" Christie made his controversial vaccination comments to reporters during his three-day trip to London, as he weighs whether to jump in the 2016 presidential field. Christie said he and his wife had vaccinated their children but understood ""that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so the balance that the government has to decide."" Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts later clarified the governor's comments, saying, ""To be clear: The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated. At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate."|2022-10-05 17:00:00|REAL|Daniel Patel|The Herald Tribune|862418|26486|58|2348|Philippines|English|2022-09-11 07:00:00|Crónica|0|True|2973600|864000|2350|0.9666666666666667

Under the Affordable Care Act, larger companies must offer the coverage in 2015. NPR's Julie Rovner filed this update for our Newscast desk: It's the second time the requirement for middle-size businesses has been postponed. Julie will have more analysis of the change later, for the Shots blog. The change was announced Monday by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. The agencies say the delay will affect only about 2 percent of U.S. employers. The agencies also announced a new rule allowing large employers to phase in the percentage of workers they cover, ""from 70 percent in 2015 to 95 percent in 2016 and beyond.""

2487|Boehner's preparing to sue Obama again — over immigration|It's hard to argue that the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has granted protection from deportation to about 600,000 unauthorized immigrants, is an acceptable use of presidential authority, but the new deferred-action program wouldn't be. After all, they both follow the same model: unauthorized immigrants who meet certain requirements will be able to apply for temporary protection, and have to renew that protection every few years. Any of the legal criticisms that apply to the new program apply to the existing one as well. But the DACA program wasn't controversial when it was first announced it's only become politically controversial in retrospect, as Obama started contemplating (and eventually took) executive action to give relief to a broader set of unauthorized immigrants. So the GOP didn't sue Obama in 2012, or even in 2014, over the existing program. Suing him now over both programs would raise the question of why Congress is only now taking legal action over something that's been going on for years, if it really thinks it's such a dire threat to the Constitution. That's relevant to the GOP's legal case, and it's relevant to the politics of the issue as well since the DACA program was pretty broadly popular when it was rolled out. (Polls are mixed on the new executive action. Depending on how the question is asked, Americans either favor letting Obama's actions stand by amargin of 15 percentage points or want it to be blocked, also by a margin of 15 percentage points.)|2022-09-24 22:00:00|REAL|Gabriel Santos|The Insight|77962|92130|352|3800|United States|English|2022-09-09 20:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|2041200|738000|1529|5.866666666666666

And it's hard to deny that there's a lot of truth in that. But there's another side to the story -- people leave Latin America because life there can be very hard. Poverty, political instability and recurring financial crises often conspire to make Latin American life more challenging than in the U.S., a wealthy country with lots of job opportunities. Living on the northern side of the U.S.-Mexico border, it's easy to view Latin America as another world, isolated from the United States. But the truth is that the U.S. government has historically made life in Latin America harder by overthrowing democratically elected governments, financing atrocities and pushing trade policies that undermine Latin American industries, dealing blows to local economies. Perhaps instead of building walls, the United States should focus on being a better neighbor.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Sunday for backing away from his push for comprehensive immigration reform, saying on ABC's ""This Week"" that he had ""folded like a cheap shotgun."" Rubio, who announced his bid for president last week, has gotten heat from some conservatives for co-authoring an immigration reform bill that would allow some undocumented immigrants to eventually become citizens, along with ramping up border security and enforcement measures. He then said in February that he'd since learned a comprehensive approach was the wrong one, and that border security should be done separately and before other reform. McCaskill said, ""He took a principled, courageous stand on immigration reform"" while helping to draft the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate in 2013 -- but then dropped those principles. ""Then the minute his party's base starting chewing on about it, the minute Rush Limbaugh criticized him, he folded like a cheap shotgun,"" she said. ""That's old politics. That's not what we need right now. That is the stalest trick in the book. That is shirking on your principles because of the political necessities of your party."" Rubio said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" in an interview that aired on Sunday that it was wrong to say he ""walked away from"" immigration reform. ""Well that's not an accurate assessment,"" he said. ""What I'm saying to people is we can't do it in a massive piece of legislation, and I know because I tried. We understand that we have to deal with 12 million human beings that are in this country, that have been here longer than a decade. We know we have to deal with this. We are not prepared to deal with it until first you can prove to us that this will never happen again."" ""Well that's a hypothetical that will never happen,"" Rubio said, reiterating he would first ask for border security and enforcement bills. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is considering a run for president and is another author of the 2013 immigration bill, also referred to Rubio's shift on immigration Sunday in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday."" When he was asked to give his thoughts on Rubio, he threw in a slight dig while praising the senator. ""He embraced immigration reform,"" he said. ""He seems to have backed off -- I'll let him explain why.

2530|Donald Trump to trek U.S.-Mexico border Thursday|"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's colorful presidential campaign heads to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday, where the billionaire businessman is sure to expand on his controversial comments about immigrants. He'll travel to Laredo, Texas, for a tour with U.S. border patrol agents. The trip comes as Trump dominates the Republican presidential contest -- both in the polls and in the headlines. He sparked a fierce debate among Republicans last month when he referred broadly to Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists . He angered many Republicans this weekend by questioning John McCain's status as a war hero. And on Tuesday, he escalated a verbal war with Lindsey Graham by releasing the South Carolina senator's cell phone number. A chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the agency's union, invited Trump earlier this month to tour one of the most active parts of the border with the agents who work there. Hector Garza, the president of the chapter, told CNN earlier this month that he wanted ""to give Donald Trump a state of the border"" and a ""boots on the ground perspective."" Garza, a border patrol agent, said his invitation was not an endorsement of Trump's presidential run, saying that his group regularly invites politicians -- including previous tours with GOP Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Blake Farenthold of Texas. He also invited Sen. Ted Cruz, who is also vying for the Republican presidential nomination, last month. Garza said his organization's only goal is to encourage policies that will lead to a strong border and a safer environment for his fellow agents. The Laredo chapter is one of the largest in the country, Garza said, representing about 1,400 border patrol agents.

His latest proposal: revoke the citizenship of American-born children of undocumented immigrants, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. On Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor"" on Tuesday night, the GOP's presidential frontrunner envisioned kicking all 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the country. ""Do you envision federal police kicking in the doors in barios around the country, dragging families out and putting them on a bus? Do you envision that?"" host Bill O'Reilly asked. ""I don't think they have American citizenship,"" he replied. ""And if you speak to very good lawyers, and I know some would disagree, (but) many agree with me, you will find they do not have American citizenship."" Trump hasn't said how he would implement his ambitious immigration plan. In New Hampshire Wednesay he talked about building what he calls a beautiful wall. ""I will build the greatest wall that you've ever seen,"" he said. ""I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they're gonna call it the Trump Wall, maybe. So I have to make sure it's beautiful, right? I'll be very proud of that wall."" Up the road at another event in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush took a few swipes at Trump, saying he's not a true conservative. ""Mr. Trump doesn't have a proven, conservative record,"" Bush said. ""He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican. He's given more money to Democrats than he's given to Republicans."" ""Even on immigration, where it's -- you know, look, it's, the language is pretty vitriolic for sure.

257|McCarthy Bombshell Leaves House GOP in Chaos|"House Republicans are in chaos after Thursday's political bombshell when Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the handpicked successor to Speaker John Boehner, announced he would not seek the post. The prospects for electing a new speaker have dimmed. House Republicans are asking who now? ""I think I shocked some of you, huh?"" McCarthy said. ""The one thing I found in talking to everybody -- if we are gonna unite and be strong, we need a new face to help do that."" ""The Republican Party has to show it can govern. We can't go on like this. This is insanity,"" he told the Daily News. McCarthy's decision came after a closed-door meeting with the same conservatives who would challenge him on the House floor as speaker. It also came after a letter from Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., calling for the next speaker to be above reproach in his or her personal life. ""I know what can happen to a party when you don't demand honesty and integrity in your leadership. I've seen it. I know what can happen,"" Jones told CBN News by phone. CBN News' Jennifer Wishon spoke with Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., about his letter to the Republican Conference Chairman. Two candidates for speaker -- Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah -- both say they were shocked by McCarthy's withdrawal. ""Our conference is gonna have to do a lot of deep soul searching,"" Chaffetz said. ""And we'll see what happens."" The House speakership is a grueling, often thankless job, something akin to herding cats, and many of the House's brightest stars simply do not want the job. Some are now urging former GOP vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to throw his hat into the ring, though he still says he's not running. Some are even throwing out the name of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is no longer a member of Congress. The House constitution does require the speaker to be an elected member. For now, the McCarthy withdrawal means Boehner will have to stay on as speaker."|2022-09-16 17:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Daily Beacon|724960|12203|142|9917|Iran|English|2022-09-13 04:00:00|Opinión del lector|0|True|1332000|1026000|1980|2.3666666666666667

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen issued a temporary injunction that gives a coalition of 26 states time to pursue a lawsuit that aims to permanently stop the president's orders. The White House said the Justice Department will appeal the decision. The ruling puts on hold Obama's orders that could spare as many as 5 million people who are in the United States illegally from deportation. On Tuesday, the White House issued a statement saying Monday's ruling ""wrongly prevents"" the president's ""lawful, commonsense polices"" from taking effect. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the federal judge's ruling was no surprise, citing Obama's repeated comments about the limits of his authority."|2022-10-09 01:00:00|REAL|Sophie Chen|Metro News|825823|10307|109|6016|Nigeria|English|2022-09-30 19:00:00|Reportaje|0|True|2548800|3261600|810|1.8166666666666667
2581|Boehner moves to push off immigration fight to 2015|"House Speaker John Boehner announced plans Tuesday to effectively push off a looming battle over President Obama's immigration policies until next year, while potentially averting a partial government shutdown later this month. The speaker met behind closed doors Tuesday with fellow Republicans. Boehner is attempting a balancing act -- as he tries to avert a budget showdown, while also letting conservatives vent over the president's controversial executive actions on immigration. Congress needs to approve a new spending bill by Dec. 11 to avoid a partial shutdown, and opposition to Obama's immigration approach has complicated that effort. The plan, as of Tuesday, is a two-step approach. The House would vote later this week for a largely symbolic measure disapproving Obama's executive actions to suspend deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally. The bill would try to block those actions, but would certainly face a presidential veto, if it made it past the Senate. The House would then vote next week on a must-pass spending bill, with a twist. The plan would fund most elements of the government for the remainder of the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, 2015. But, under one proposal, it would only fund immigration-related activities until early next year -- setting up a new fight over immigration in early 2015, when Republicans control both the House and Senate. While Obama's Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was being grilled over immigration at a Capitol Hill hearing, Boehner said Tuesday that Obama has ignored the American people. ""This is a serious breach of our Constitution,"" Boehner said. He also said lawmakers ""have limited options and abilities to deal with it directly."" It's unclear whether Boehner's plan has enough support. Some conservatives want more; they circulated bill language Monday stipulating that no money or fees ""may be used by any agency to implement, administer, enforce or carry out any of the policy changes"" announced by Obama. Meanwhile, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi put Republicans on notice last week that her party wouldn't support a plan that didn't fund the government for the entire fiscal year and also chipped away at some immigration-related activities. In the Senate, Democrats still maintain the majority and could cause problems for any plan that does not fully fund the government through next year. Fox News' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report."|2022-09-23 12:00:00|REAL|Ava Murphy|Urban News|438968|74327|86|5238|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-22 04:00:00|Columna de humor|1|True|1918800|1803600|2478|1.4333333333333333

2584|Netanyahu blasts ‘very, very bad’ Iran nuclear agreement|"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the framework agreement reached by world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program, repeatedly calling it a ""free path to a bomb"" that will spark an arms race in the Middle East. Under the framework announced last week, international sanctions would be lifted in phases if Iran meets its commitments. The International Atomic Energy Agency would conduct inspections to monitor significant limits on Iranian nuclear facilities, and the restrictions would be in place for at least a decade. In a series of interviews on Sunday political talk shows, Netanyahu called for world leaders to strike a ""better deal"" that significantly and permanently rolls back Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Sanctions should be ratcheted up not lifted to pressure Iran until it stops its ""aggression in the region,"" he said. Netanyahu questioned whether inspections would be effective, saying Iran has shown that it cannot be trusted. ""I wouldn't bet the shop on inspections,"" the Israeli leader said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's not a country that you can place your trust in. And it's not a country that you're going to resolve its congenital cheating. You're just not going to replace it by placing more inspectors there."" The ""very, very bad"" agreement only allows Iran to build a vast arsenal by placing temporary restrictions and lifting sanctions that had crippled the country's economy, Netanyahu said. He repeatedly said the agreement would ""pump up their terror machine worldwide."" Echoing concerns among skeptics of the framework, Netanyahu said it would spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, with Sunnis states already seeing Shiite Iran as a major threat. ""I think this is a dream deal for Iran and a nightmare deal for the world,"" Netanyahu said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Netanyahu did not outwardly criticize President Obama, but he said there is a ""legitimate difference of view"" between the two leaders. Netanyahu said he believes Obama is doing what is best for the United States. But the agreement will jeopardize not only Israel but also surrounding countries in the Middle East, the Israeli leader said on ABC's ""This Week."" The framework agreement does not block Iran's path to nuclear weapons, and instead paves it, he said."|2022-09-27 21:00:00|REAL|Amelia Rivera|The Informer|45486|66155|257|733|Indonesia|English|2022-09-08 05:00:00|Análisis|1|True|597600|2296800|2287|4.283333333333333

2601|Netanyahu blasts Obama's Iran nuclear deal|"Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took his protest of the Iran nuclear agreement to the U.S. airwaves on Sunday. ""This deal will both threaten us and threaten our neighbors,"" Netanyahu said on CNN's State of the Union. Netanyahu, who also appeared on NBC's Meet The Press and ABC's This Week, said the proposal will leave Iran's nuclear infrastructure in place. The Israeli leader spoke days after the U.S., allies and Iran reached the framework of an agreement in which the allies would reduce sanctions on Iran if it gives up the means to make nuclear weapons. The parties will now try to work out the details of a final agreement, with a deadline of June 30. President Obama and aides said diplomacy is the only alternative to military action against Iran's nuclear program. In his weekend radio address, Obama said the agreement would deny Iran the plutonium and enriched uranium needed to build a nuclear weapon. ""Moreover,"" Obama said, ""international inspectors will have unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear program because Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world, If Iran cheats, the world will know it."" In his television appearances, Netanyahu said the United States and its allies should intensify economic sanctions on Iran in order to force it to give up more of its nuclear program. He also questioned the effectiveness of inspections, saying Iran has cheated in the past. ""I'm not trying to kill any deal,"" Netanyahu said on NBC. ""I'm trying to kill a bad deal."" Netanyahu also said the framework will lift sanctions on Iran too quickly, improving its economy. He told ABC that Iranian leaders will use the new money ""to pump up their terror machine worldwide."" Iran, meanwhile, says its nuclear program is designed for peaceful energy purposes, not weapons. In his radio address, Obama said he is looking forward to the debate with critics over Iran. ""As president and commander in chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option a comprehensive, long-term deal like this is by far the best option,"" Obama said. ""For the United States. For our allies. And for the world."|2022-10-10 19:00:00|REAL|Alexander Lee|Morning Star|186982|70448|99|4021|Japan|English|2022-09-18 13:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|1490400|3412800|2126|1.65
2602|Boehner: Israel trip planned before Netanyahu-Obama rift|"The Ohio Republican will travel to Israel this week, while Congress is on recess. He said his plans were made before the rift between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama over how to deal with Iran and Palestine burst into the open. ""There are serious issues and activities going on in the Middle East and I think it's critically important for members of Congress to hear from foreign leaders, other governments, other parts of their government, to get a real handle on the challenges that we face there,"" Boehner told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. Republicans are using the congressional recess to visit Israel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was there Sunday, and met with Netanyahu. Boehner said Netanyahu -- who's been lambasted by Obama for his comments in the lead-up to Israel's election that a two-state solution to Israel and Palestine's divide is impossible -- didn't cross any lines. ""Well, he doesn't have a partner,"" Boehner said. ""How do you have a two-state solution when you don't have a partner in that solution, when you don't have a partner for peace, when you've got a -- when the other state is vowing to wipe you off the face of the earth?"" And he promised to move ""very"" quickly toward imposing steep new sanctions on Iran if Obama doesn't strike a deal with the country to avert its nuclear ambitions -- a deal that Netanyahu opposed during a high-profile speech to Congress during an early-March trip to Washington. Boehner also defended Netanyahu from criticism from Obama and the White House that has mounted over the last month. ""I think the animosity exhibited by our administration toward the prime minister of Israel is reprehensible,"" Boehner said. ""And I think that the pressure that they've put on him over the last four or five years have frankly pushed him to the point where he had to speak up."" ""I don't blame him at all for speaking up,"" he said."|2022-10-08 06:00:00|REAL|Jacob Gupta|Newsflash|196089|37372|182|5019|Nigeria|English|2022-09-07 14:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|543600|3193200|1924|3.033333333333333
2605|Netanyahu: Obama's Iranian Nuclear Deal Worse Than Israel Feared|"Israel has mounted what it terms an ""uphill battle"" against an agreement that might ease sanctions on the Iranians while leaving them with a nuclear infrastructure with bomb-making potential. Tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful. ""This deal, as it appears to be emerging, bears out all of our fears, and even more than that,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet in Jerusalem as the United States, five other world powers and Iran worked toward a March 31 deadline in Lausanne, Switzerland. Noting advances made by Iranian-allied forces in Yemen and other Arab countries, Netanyahu accused the Islamic republic of trying to ""conquer the entire Middle East"" while moving toward nuclearization. ""The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity, and must be stopped,"" he said. Netanyahu's campaigning against the nuclear negotiations crested on March 3 with his speech to the U.S. Congress at the invitation of its Republican speaker, John Boehner, that angered President Barack Obama and many fellow Democrats. The right-wing prime minister, who won a fourth term in a March 17 election, said on Sunday he had spoken to senior U.S. lawmakers from both parties ""and heard from them about the steadfast, strong and continuous bipartisan support for Israel"". Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli official who has been spearheading efforts to lobby world powers against the Iran deal, voiced cautious hope that the negotiations would collapse as they have in the past. ""We may still have a chance. We are not alone. There are still great doubts in the United States as well as in France, even in England,"" Steinitz told Israel Radio, referring to disputes with Iran over the scope of nuclear projects it might be allowed to retain. But Steinitz said Israel, which is not a party to the talks and whose hardline demands have not been welcomed in Western capitals, was in an ""uphill battle"". Another senior Israeli official, Security Cabinet Minister Gilad Erdan, saw a ""good chance"" of the powers and Iran reaching a framework deal by the Tuesday deadline, after which they would turn to the end-of-June target date for a comprehensive accord - a final stretch in which more counter-lobbying could be mounted. ""This is not over yet. There's the Congress, and also the players involved in the negotiations themselves have not agreed on all terms,"" Erdan told Israel's Army Radio. ""There is still a great amount of room in which to operate diplomatically before the final accord."|2022-10-01 06:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Capital Gazette|726677|19548|111|5003|Tanzania|English|2022-09-11 03:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|849600|2588400|2496|1.85

2616|Netanyahu Defeats Center-Left Rival In Israel's Parliamentary Election|"With nearly all votes counted in elections for the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Benjamin Netanyahu's center-right Likud party has won at least a five-seat victory over its principal rival, the center-left Zionist Union. Israeli media report Likud has 29 or 30 seats in the 120-member Knesset to the Zionist Union's 24 seats. Exit polls by Israel's three main television channels initially showed Likud and the Zionist Union more or less tied. Shortly after midnight in Israel the Zionist Union Chairman Yitzhak Herzog predicted a return to power of the center-left. But as the actual votes were counted the results were quite different. Netanyahu must assemble a coalition of parties totaling at least 61 seats to form a new government. If he succeeds in forming a coalition government, Netanyahu would begin a historic fourth term as prime minister of Israel. The Associated Press says Netanyahu's victory ""likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States. ""Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community. ""In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state a key policy goal of the White House and the international community. He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.

2625|Iran calls for assassination of Netanyahu's children|Iran is encouraging its terror allies to pursue the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin children by publishing personal information about them, including photographs of the kids lined up in crosshairs, and declaring, We must await the hunt of Hezbollah. The publication of the personal information and biographies of children follows an Israeli airstrike last week that killed several key Hezbollah leaders and an Iranian commander affiliated with the hardline Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Iranian military leaders affiliated with the IRGC threatened in recent days harsh retaliation for the strike and promised to amp up support for Hezbollah as well as Palestinian terrorist organizations. The information was originally published in Farsi by an Iranian website affiliated with the IRGC and quickly republished by state-controlled Fars News Agency. In addition to biographical details and pictures of children, the Iranians provided details about the families of former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ariel Sharon.

The consent decree is the next step after the city agreed to changes last year following a scathing report from DOJ investigators regarding patterns of civil rights violations and excessive force by the Cleveland police . It will mean years of court-supervised monitoring of the Cleveland Police Department. In a 105-page report , Justice and city leaders unveiled reforms that included commitments to ""bias-free policing"" , new crisis-intervention efforts and changes to officer recruitment and discipline. The leaders called on the city to buy into the changes and embrace what they billed as a transformation in the city's policing. ""I am issuing a call of action to our entire community to support this hard work together,"" said U.S. Attorney Steven M. Dettelbach. ""The people who may criticize the police are not the enemy -- they are part of the community."" When then-Attorney General Eric Holder announced the findings in December, the city's mayor and police chief said they were in agreement that recommended changes had to be implemented.

2659|Report on hiring, quits brightens labor market picture|"Employers hired more workers in March even as the number of job openings fell slightly, the Labor Department said Tuesday. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey points to a stronger labor market two months ago than another government report suggested Friday. Labor said last week that employers added a net 85,000 jobs in March, including hiring and layoffs, as payroll growth sputtered amid frigid weather and a pullback in drilling by oil producers, among other factors. That was the lowest total since June 2012. Job gains rebounded to 223,000 in April. Tuesday's JOLTS report provides a more granular view of employee movements and shows a more encouraging picture. The number of hires, for example, increased by 56,000 to about 5.1 million. Hiring increased in retail, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality. It declined in construction, manufacturing and education and health services. Part of the reason net job gains were weak is that layoffs and discharges also picked up, rising by 105,000, or 6.2%, to 1.8 million. At least some of those job cuts were in the oil industry, which continues to shed workers in response to low crude prices. Meanwhile, about 2.8 million Americans quit their jobs the most since April 2008 up from 2.7 million in February. A large number of quits is a sign of a dynamic labor market in which workers feel confident enough to leave one job for another. Overall, the report ""helps ease concerns that the weak 85,000 (job gain total) for March was the start of a new trend,"" says Barclays Capital economist Jesse Hurwitz. ""Confidence remains intact."" Less encouraging is that job openings fell by 150,000 to 5 million after hitting a 14-year high in February. But economist Daniel Silver of JPMorgan Chase notes that openings were still up about 18% from the year-ago period. Another measure of the labor market's progress is that there were 1.7 unemployed workers for each job opening in March, down sharply from a high of 6.7 in 2009. That shows the labor market is continuing to tighten, aiding job seekers, though at a slower pace than last year, Hurwitz says. He expects job gains to pick up to a solid monthly average of 200,000 to 225,000 for the rest of 2015. That would mark an uptick from the 184,000 monthly pace in the first quarter but a slowdown from last year's brisk clip of 260,000. Last week, Labor said that employers added 223,000 jobs in April."|2022-10-11 02:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|National Courier|72336|94887|423|4392|United States|English|2022-09-19 03:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3438000|1540800|2432|7.05
2662|Are private unions cooling toward Democrats?|"President Obama has long been a friend of organized labor, wholeheartedly supported by unions that helped boost him to victory in both his presidential campaigns.But increasingly, there now is a divide between unions in the public and private sector when it comes to supporting him. According to James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, government employee unions want ""bigger and more expensive government,"" in contrast to private sector unions. Sherk added those private groups are ""pushing back"" and speaking out more publicly about things like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which they believe will benefit their members. That has put them on a collision course with Obama, who last summer proclaimed, ""We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country."" ""The president's insistence on vetoing this pipeline is directly taking away income from these union members, and they, understandably, don't like it,"" Sherk said. Congress has passed a measure to expedite the Keystone project, although Obama has vowed to veto it. Just days ago, Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, made a direct appeal. ""We urge the president of the United States to put our men and women back to work across the length of this pipeline as soon as possible,"" McGarvey said, adding, ""We urge the president to sign the bill."" Union leaders also have a long-standing beef with the administration over the Affordable Care Act's enormous tax on so-called Cadillac health insurance plans.The plans offer high dollar benefits and are used as a recruiting tool. Although the tax doesn't kick in for several more years, as far back as 2013 union leaders were making public pleas to Democratic lawmakers. In a letter written in July of that year, union officials, including James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, urged congressional Democrats to drop the tax saying, ""We voted for you.We have a problem; you need to fix it."" Analysts say the issue may present an opportunity for GOP leaders to build some good will with unions. Just days ago, Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H., introduced a measure he's calling ""Ax the Tax.""A similar measure didn't get far in the Senate last year, but may have a better chance with the GOP now in control of both the House and Senate."|2022-10-10 12:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|City Beat|120916|59627|246|4852|Tanzania|English|2022-09-12 07:00:00|Reportaje especial|1|True|950400|3387600|2329|4.1

The editorial board wrote that Clinton ""is not only more knowledgeable about domestic and international affairs than Sanders, but also more likely to achieve objectives they have in common."" The board also opined Friday that Clinton has a ""steadiness, seriousness and a commanding grasp of issues about which the blowhard businessman is dangerously ignorant."" The paper was not shy in noting Clinton's liabilities, though, writing that the former first lady has a ""penchant for secrecy and self-protection"" as reflected in her exclusive use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state. The California primary is expected to put Clinton well over the number of delegates she needs to clinch the Democratic nomination. Clinton nodded to as much during her swing through the state on Friday.

2692|A Golden Rule for journalists: Objectivity is a myth but fairness is a must|Back when I was a pup of a reporter, a wise old editor at The New York Times pulled me aside after I submitted a news story with too much attitude. His name was Shelly Binn, and never forget the bright red line he drew for me. Nobody expects you to be objective, he said. impossible because we all have feelings and opinions. But you have to be fair to both sides, no matter how you feel. There it was, a golden rule of journalism: Objectivity is a myth, fairness is a must. Obviously, the CNBC debate moderators never got the lesson. The news business is in trouble and overt displays of media bias of the kind we witnessed Wednesday are a big reason. Technology and changing lifestyles have fractured markets and wrecked revenues, but self-inflicted wounds compound the damage. The relentless badgering, arrogance and ignorance toward the GOP candidates was so bad that their performance was universally panned, no small feat at a time when the media, like everything else, is polarized.

2726|“Idiocy”: New York Times editorial board scorches GOP’s nuclear sabotage|In keeping with the generally staid disposition of the Gray Lady, one might have expected the New York Times editorial board to chide the Republican senators seeking to torpedo the Iran nuclear talks as misguided, wrongheaded, imprudent, or some such. But instead, the Times on Thursday published a scathing editorial condemning the diplomatic sabotage in unusually blistering language: The stunts, the headline announces, reflect nothing less than Republican Idiocy on Iran. Denouncing Sen. Tom (R-AR) disgraceful and irresponsible letter to the Iranian leadership signed by 46 other GOP senators the editors contend that by warning leaders that a future president could nix a nuclear deal, Republicans engaged in a blatant, dangerous effort to undercut the president on a grave national security issue by communicating directly with a foreign government. Besides being willing to sabotage any deal with Iran (before they know the final details), these Republicans are perfectly willing to diminish standing as a global power capable of crafting international commitments and adhering to them, the editors write, echoing the criticism put forth by Vice President Joe Biden, who issued a statement this week arguing that the letter conveys a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our Commander-in-Chief cannot deliver on commitments a message that is as false as it is dangerous. Although many Cotton detractors seized on the Iranian foreign swift dismissal of the communiqué, the Times notes that it could nevertheless embolden hard-liners in Iran who seek confrontation, not conciliation. In rejecting diplomacy, the Republicans make an Iranian bomb and military conflict more likely, the Times concludes. For many, that may be precisely the point.|2022-09-18 18:00:00|REAL|Gabriel Santos|Metro News|484259|91320|656|3439|Uganda|English|2022-09-08 04:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|1508400|594000|1771|10.933333333333334
2734|Another Brian Williams Story Comes Into Question|"As the Washington Post points out, Williams told two different versions of a story about covering the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War. In one interview, he said he was nearly hit by rockets while flying in a helicopter over northern Israel. However, when he had originally written about the experience, that detail never came up. In fact, he only described activity that occurred nowhere near his helicopter. He also told the Daily Show that rockets were ""1,500 feet beneath us.""

Williams is taking a temporary leave of absence from the network, and cancelled a planned appearance on CBS' ""Late Show with David Letterman."" Other anecdotes Williams has told over the years are getting the magnifying glass treatment as well, including a tale he repeatedly shared about being mugged at gunpoint back in the 1970s.

2746|White House, NYT leave Bushes out of lead photos from Selma march|"The decision by The New York Times to run a front-page image on Sunday of President Obama -- and family -- leading a march to mark the 50th anniversary of the Selma civil rights clashes, while leaving out of the image former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, apparently was mirrored in the ""official White House photo"" of the event. The official White House blog's Sunday entry on the Alabama march led with a similar image, focusing on Obama and his family, as well as civil rights figures, but leaving out the Bushes. Both images show Obama walking alongside Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, and even Al Sharpton, as they led thousands across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The White House blog does acknowledge in the caption that the Bushes were there, and the photo at the bottom of the page includes them off to the side. Part of the problem may have been the staging of the event itself. Basil Smikle Jr., a Democratic strategist and former advance team member for the Clinton White House, noted that the Bushes were not standing directly next to the Obamas. He told Fox News he would have liked to see both presidents together, at least in the New York Times photo. ""Both presidents should have been close together,"" he said. Regardless, the Bushes were standing but a few feet away from the first family and were included in other photos. A spokeswoman for the Times told FoxNews.com that the newspaper did not crop the Bush family out of the original image for the front-page display. Still, the decision not to run a photo that did include them drew criticism on Monday. ""This is a stunning example of media bias,"" said Deneen Borelli, a Fox News contributor and outreach director for the conservative FreedomWorks. The Associated Press also ran a variety of photos after they crossed the bridge, some of which show the Bushes and some of which do not. However, it appears the AP did not run photos showing the Bushes before they marched across the bridge. The Times' article on the event did mention the Bushes' attendance, after the jump. The article notes that in 2006, he signed the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act."|2022-10-06 11:00:00|REAL|William Kumar|Press Pulse|202297|6836|84|3383|Bangladesh|English|2022-09-27 11:00:00|Columna|1|True|3038400|2260800|2148|1.4
2768|The Saber Rattling Between Saudis, Iran Just Got More Ominous|"JERUSALEM, Israel An unknown group in Iran posted an animated film on the Internet simulating a missile attack on Saudi Arabia, including an attack on their main oil fields. While it's unclear who made the video, it highlights the growing animosity between these two Middle East giants. The animation simulates an Iranian rocket attack using missiles fired from Yemen. The attack is designed to cripple Saudi Arabia on multiple fronts. The video states it's a ""response to the hallucinations and empty threats of the Saud clan"" and that ""the arm of vengeance of the Islamic world will emerge from the sleeve of the Yemenis."" The video reveals the GPS coordinates of Saudi Arabia's main oil facility at the Ghawar Oil Field and then shows the missiles destroying the Saudi Aramco facility and setting the area on fire. It also simulates attacks on Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, which it calls the Freemason Tower. Then it shows missiles striking the Saudis' main air base and crippling its anti-missile system. The rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran intensified when the Saudis executed a top Shiite cleric. Iran followed by allowing protesters to ransack the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Tehran, prompting Saudi Arabia to cut diplomatic relations. Pakistan then weighed in on the side of the Saudis, saying they would wipe Iran off the map if it threatened the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia. The concern for many in the region is that the rivalry between the two Middle East titans will go from a war of words to a war on the battlefield."|2022-10-02 02:00:00|REAL|Nora Patel|Voice of the Nation|784818|17976|24|4469|Myanmar|English|2022-09-03 04:00:00|Artículo de investigación|0|True|162000|2660400|1560|0.4
2780|Jimmy Carter offers help for Russia’s bombing campaign in Syria|Former President Jimmy Carter said recently that he provided maps of Islamic State positions in Syria to the Russian embassy in Washington, a move apparently at odds with the Obama official policy of not cooperating with Russia in the Syrian war. Carter said on Sunday in Georgia that he knows Russian President Vladimir Putin fairly well because they have a common interest in fly fishing. When he met with Putin in April along with other global leaders to discuss the crises in Syria and Ukraine, the Russian president gave him an email address so the two could discuss his fly fishing experiences, particularly in Russia, Carter said. The civil war in Syria, where U.S. officials say Russia has bombed rebels and CIA-backed groups rather than the Islamic State terrorist group, has also been a topic of conversation between the two. Carter said he sent maps of the Islamic locations in Syria, produced by the Carter Center, to the Russian embassy so Moscow could improve the accuracy of its strikes. I sent [Putin] a message Thursday and asked him if he wanted a copy of our map so he could bomb accurately in Syria, and then on Friday, the Russian embassy in mean in Washington, called down and told me they would like very much to have the map, Carter said at his Sunday school class in Georgia, according to a video of his remarks first aired by NBC News. So in the future, if Russia bomb the right places, know not fault but my fault, he added as the audience laughed. Obama administration officials have publicly said the United States will not collaborate with Russia as long as it targets U.S.-backed rebels in an effort to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a longtime ally of Moscow. The administration has said Assad must eventually step down as part of efforts to seek a political resolution to the Syrian war. We are not prepared to cooperate on strategy which, as we explained, is flawed, tragically flawed, on the part, said Ash Carter, U.S. defense secretary, earlier this month.

The remarks by Clinton -- who has disavowed her own 2003 vote for the Iraq war as a senator -- come amid growing fervor among Republicans to send ground forces back to Iraq in some capacity to assist the Baghdad government in its battle with Islamic State, which earlier this week overran the city of Ramadi. The Democratic front-runner made her comments during a brief news conference here at a brewery following a roundtable discussion with small-business leaders. ""I think it's a very difficult situation and I basically agree with the policies that we are currently following,"" Clinton said. ""And that is, American air support is available. American intelligence and surveillance is available. American trainers are trying to undo the damage that was done to the Iraqi army by former prime minister Maliki, who bears a very big part of the responsibility for what is happening inside of Iraq today.""

2872|ISIS Claims Responsibility for Deadly Bombing in Afghanistan|"The Islamic State (IS) group claimed to have carried out a deadly suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan Saturday that killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said, in what, if verified, would be the first major attack claimed by the jihadist group in the country. ""Who claimed responsibility for horrific attack in Nangarhar today? The Taliban did not claim responsibility for the attack, Daesh (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack,"" President Ghani said on a visit to northeastern Badakhshan province. A person purporting to be an IS spokesman said in a call to AFP that the group claimed responsibility for the bombing outside a bank in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. An online posting allegedly from the group made the same claim, which could not be immediately verified. ""Thirty-three dead bodies and more than 100 wounded were brought to the hospital,"" Dr Najeebullah Kamawal, head of the provincial hospital, told AFP. Ahmad Zia Abdulzai, a provincial government spokesman, confirmed the attack -- the deadliest since November. ""The explosion happened outside the bank when government employees and civilians were collecting their monthly salaries,"" he told AFP. The UN gave a higher toll, saying 35 people had been killed. President Ghani strongly condemned the attack, which saw children among those killed, his office said in a statement. ""Carrying out terrorist attacks in cities and public places are the most cowardly acts of terror by terrorists targeting innocent civilians,"" President Ghani said. The scene of the attack showed the gruesome scale of the carnage with people lying in pools of blood and body parts scattered across the ground. The bombing comes as Afghanistan braces for what is expected to be a bloody push by the Taliban at the start of the fighting season. The militants have stepped up attacks on government and foreign targets since Washington backpedalled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half. The Taliban have seen defections to IS in recent months, with some insurgents voicing their disaffection with their one-eyed supreme leader Mullah Omar, who has not been seen since the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan. The Afghan government has also raised the ominous prospect of IS making inroads into the country, though the group that has captured swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq has never formally acknowledged having a presence in Afghanistan."|2022-09-11 19:00:00|REAL|Ella Sharma|Evening Echo|855170|34119|19|1235|Turkey|English|2022-09-01 22:00:00|Crónica|0|True|907200|54000|2480|0.31666666666666665

2882|Kerry tells Capitol Hill critics of Iran nuclear deal to 'hold their fire' until final deal|"Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that he will go to Capitol Hill this week to brief congressional members about the Obama Iran nuclear deal and urged opponents to hold their fire until they see a final deal later his year. The administration has since reaching the April 1 deal urged the Senate not to vote on legislation that would require congressional approval to ease sanctions on Iran, as Tehran curtails its uranium-enrichment program. And President Obama has vowed to veto such legislation, if passed. Kerry said he would brief House members on Monday and senators on Tuesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is set to take up the legislation on the same day. The administration should be free to negotiate without interference until the June 30 deadline for a final agreement, Kerry said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""We've earned the right to be able to try and complete this without interference, and certainly without partisan politics,"" Kerry said. The Senate bill, by committee chairman Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., would give Congress a 60-day review and a say on any deal. Under the bill as currently written, Obama could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on Iran through presidential action. But Congress could block the president from providing Iran with any relief from congressional sanctions. Senators on both sides of the issue have introduced more than 50 amendments to the legislation. Opponents of the deal say they know the exact details because both sides are giving different interpretations. Among their concerns are the guidelines for inspecting Iran's nuclear sites and when the sanctions will be lifted. Kerry told Meet the Press the United States sign a bad or ambiguous deal. If not an understanding, we sign it, he said.

2885|Iran's Supreme Leader Slams Republican Letter On Nuke Deal|"DUBAI, March 12 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader hit out on Thursday at a letter by U.S. Republican senators threatening to undo any nuclear deal between Washington and Tehran, saying he was worried because the United States was known for ""backstabbing,"" Mehr news agency reported. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei added at a meeting with President Hassan Rouhani and senior clerics that whenever negotiators made progress, the Americans became ""harsher, tougher and coarser,"" Mehr reported. The letter signed by 47 Republican senators warned Iran that any nuclear deal made with U.S. President Barack Obama could last only as long as he remained in office, in an unusual intervention into U.S. foreign policy-making. Mehr quoted Khamenei as saying: ""Of course I am worried, because the other side is known for opacity, deceit and backstabbing."" ""Every time we reach a stage where the end of the negotiations is in sight, the tone of the other side, specifically the Americans, becomes harsher, coarser and tougher. This is the nature of their tricks and deceptions."" The negotiations, which resume in Lausanne, Switzerland, next week, are at a critical juncture as the sides try to meet an end of March target for an interim deal, with a final deal in June. Khamenei added that U.S. accusations of Iranian involvement in terrorism were risible. Khamenei also criticized a speech to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this month that warned the United States it was negotiating a bad deal with Iran that could spark a ""nuclear nightmare."|2022-10-06 05:00:00|REAL|Daniel Patel|Metro News|787536|64357|144|5104|Brazil|English|2022-09-14 11:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|1137600|3016800|1547|2.4

2900|Netanyahu — Flanked by Boehner — Calls for 'Better Deal' with Iran|"He made the comments before meeting in Jerusalem with the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, John Boehner, a leading Republican and strong critic of the White House's policy on Iran. ""Now is the time for the international community to insist on a better deal,"" Netanyahu said in a televised statement delivered in English. ""A better deal would significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure. A better deal would link the eventual lifting of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear programme to a change in Iran's behaviour,"" he said, citing threats to annihilate Israel and accusing Tehran of fomenting regional conflict. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that a framework agreement sought by international negotiators to rein in Iran's nuclear programme would leave it with the capability to develop atomic weapons within a year. Six world powers and Iran went beyond a midnight deadline and were continuing to negotiate in the Swiss city of Lausanne on Wednesday, having failed to agree on crucial details such as the lifting of U.N. sanctions. Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, is not a party to the negotiations. Iran was expected to be high on the agenda of Netanyahu's talks with Boehner, who is visiting the region with a Republican delegation. Avoiding stepping deeper into controversy with the White House over the issue, neither Boehner nor Netanyahu mentioned the nuclear talks in comments to reporters at the Israeli leader's office. Boehner's invitation to Netanyahu to address the U.S. Congress last month on the Iranian issue drew accusations that both men were pursuing partisan politics at the expense of traditionally wide support for Israel on Capitol Hill. ""The bonds between the United States and Israel are as strong as ever,"" Boehner said. ""Our two countries cooperate on many different levels and while we may have political disagreements from time to time, the bonds between our two nations are strong and they're going to continue to be strong."" Congress has cautioned it would consider imposing new sanctions on Iran if there was no agreement in Lausanne this week. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any such sanctions moves. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that if a framework deal is reached, lawmakers would consider a bill that would require Obama to submit a final accord for Congress' approval."|2022-10-03 04:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|The Pulse|417210|96846|19|8112|Argentina|English|2022-09-12 05:00:00|Reportaje especial|1|True|2754000|943200|2400|0.31666666666666665

2913|Gen. Petraeus: Biggest threat to Iraq's stability is Iran-backed militias, not ISIS|"Former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus says the biggest threat to long-term stability in Iraq the Islamic State -- but instead, Iran-backed Shiite militias. What has happened in Iraq is a tragedy for the Iraqi people, for the region and for the entire world. It is tragic foremost because it didn't have to turn out this way, Petraeus told The Washington Post. The hard-earned progress of the surge was sustained for over three years. What transpired after that, starting in late 2011, came about as a result of mistakes and misjudgments whose consequences were predictable. Petraeus, who continues to advise the Obama administration on Iraq despite his recent guilty plea for leaking classified information to his former mistress, says there is plenty of blame to go around for the chaos in the region. But Petraeus told the Post he thinks Iraq and coalition forces are making progress against ISIS. ""In fact,"" he said, ""I would argue that the foremost threat to Iraq's long-term stability and the broader regional equilibrium is not the Islamic State; rather, it is Shiite militias, many backed by -- and some guided by -- Iran."" He told the Post the Iran-backed militias returned to the streets of Iraq in response to a fatwa by Shia leader Grand Ayatollah Sistani during a moment of extreme danger and acknowledged this prevented ISIS from continuing its offensive into Baghdad. But he said the militias went after Sunni civilians as well as extremists, ""and committed atrocities against them. resulted is that the group has been both part of salvation but also its the most serious threat in the campaign to get the Sunni Arab population in Iraq to believe they have a say, Petraeus argued. Petraeus, 62, admitted to having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, following his resignation as CIA director. Prosecutors claimed that while Broadwell was writing her book in 2011, Petraeus gave her binders with classified information he kept while he was top military commander in Afghanistan. In addition to working with the Obama administration, Petraeus has started to re-enter public life. a scholar at Kennedy School of Government and has taken a job at KKR & Co., a private-equity firm known for its large corporate takeovers."|2022-10-07 16:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Star Sentinel|554925|58903|204|9020|Argentina|English|2022-09-22 11:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|1828800|3142800|2255|3.4

292|Will Nancy Pelosi miss John Boehner? Depends.|"It depends on what comes next,"" Pelosi told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview set to air in full Sunday on ""State of the Union."" Pelosi, who has been the top House Democrat opposite Boehner at the negotiating table since Boehner took the helm of the House GOP caucus in 2007, called Boehner a ""very fine person."" Boehner announced Friday that he has decided to resign his seat in Congress effective Oct. 30. ""We can agree to disagree without being negative about each other. But, uh, yeah, I don't know if I'll miss him,"" Pelosi said. ""We just work. We barely have time for our close friends and some of our close friends are across the aisle."" But as hardline conservatives within the House GOP caucus eye Boehner's exit as an opportunity to install a new House speaker who will be more intransigent on conservative causes and less willing to compromise with Democrats, Boehner's absence could also signal a more difficult legislative process for Democrats. While Pelosi and Boehner have engaged in numerous partisan spats over the years, Boehner ultimately drew fire from tea party conservatives in his party who wanted him to take a harder line in negotiations with Democrats -- believing that he was too quick to compromise. Just a day before Boehner announced his resignation, the top House Democrat and Republican together enjoyed the visit of Pope Francis. The two are both devout Catholics and Pelosi noted Boehner's role in helping to organize the visit. ""He had his glorious moment with the Pope coming this week.

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) launched a long-shot campaign Sunday for speaker of the House of Representatives, in the latest episode of the conservative rebellion against current Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). House members are set to vote for their next speaker on Tuesday, with Boehner heavily favored to win. Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) said Saturday that he is willing to serve as an alternative to Boehner. In addition, Reps. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) have stated that they will oppose Boehner's re-election. Gohmert's latest objection to Boehner -- although certainly not his only one -- was the speaker's decision to pass the so-called ""cromnibus"" spending bill in December without including a measure to block President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. ""It was a terrible strategy and it follows a number of years of broken promises,"" Gohmert said on ""Fox & Friends"" while announcing his candidacy. ""It's time for a change."" The congressman said that if he were elected speaker, he would fight to end ""amnesty"" for immigrants and Obamacare. He added that he would make sure members got a voice, going so far as to imply Boehner was acting like a ""dictator."" ""We will go through regular committee process so everybody, every representative from both parties, will have a chance to participate in the process and not have a dictator running things, deciding who's the chairman, who gets what committee, what bills come to the floor,"" Gohmert said. He noted that it would take 29 conservatives voting against Boehner to bring the speakership up for secondary votes, which would be the first step toward eventually electing another Republican as speaker. Only 12 Republicans voted against Boehner for the position in 2013, including Gohmert, Yoho, Bridenstine and Massie."|2022-09-26 11:00:00|REAL|Ava Murphy|City Times|675492|82884|65|4801|Argentina|English|2022-09-16 21:00:00|Crítica|0|True|1346400|2174400|1826|1.0833333333333333

Clinton made the comment defending her push for regime change in the war-torn North African nation at an Illinois town hall hosted by MSNBC. ""Now, is Libya perfect? It isn't,"" Clinton said. After contrasting her approach toward Libya with the ongoing bloodshed in Syria's civil war, Clinton said ""Libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single person ... We have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO."" Clinton made no mention of the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, information officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALS Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Questions about the attack and its aftermath have dogged Clinton throughout her second run for the White House, with emails released by the State Department contradicting several aspects of her testimony before the House Select Committee investigating the attack. Earlier Monday, Clinton's campaign was forced to scramble to clarify comments she made about coal jobs at a CNN town hall Sunday night. ""I'm the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country,"" Clinton said, ""because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" With many workers in crucial primary states like Ohio and Illinois relying on such jobs, Clinton's campaign put out a statement stressing that, Coal will remain a part of the energy mix for years to come and plan would also safeguard retirement and health benefits.

A day earlier, Obama urged Congress ""to work through this recess and identify a way to get this done."" ""This needs to get done,"" he said during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The National Security Agency's bulk metadata collection program, which has allowed the NSA to collect and store phone data on millions of Americans, will sunset on Monday unless Congress passes legislation by midnight on Sunday. Obama and Lynch have endorsed the USA Freedom Act, the bill to make changes to the Patriot Act that overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives but came three votes shy of passage in the Senate this weekend. Obama said Tuesday that bill ""strikes an appropriate balance; our intelligence communities are confident that they can work with the authorities that are provided in that act."" Under that plan, phone companies would store their customers' metadata and the NSA would need to obtain a specific, targeted warrant to get a customer's data. His comments came after the Senate failed in a rare overnight session this weekend to pass the USA Freedom Act or a short-term extension of the Patriot Act's expiring provisions as reform opponents and the staunchest anti-surveillance advocates stood firm on their positions. The Senate now stands in recess until next Sunday, though Senate dealmakers are working this week to find a way to keep the programs from lapsing.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will try again on May 31, the day before the provisions expire. The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic phone records. That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short. The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program.

Majority Leader McConnell tried to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing on June 1, when the Patriot Act provision expires, Henry reports. McConnell first proposed a measure to extend the act to June 8. But Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential contender, objected, saying he wants two amendments debated and voted on. ""Our forefathers would be aghast,"" Paul said. Henry reports that McConnell then tried for an extension to June 5, but there was an objection. His proposal for June 3 met another objection; then Paul objected to a June 2 extension, Henry says. Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring. The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports. The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press."|2022-09-25 09:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Metro News|660007|89952|18|9405|Kenya|English|2022-09-06 03:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|2080800|417600|2291|0.3
2983|Christie accuses Paul, Lee of siding with ‘criminal’ Snowden on NSA|"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie lashed out at Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Fox and Friends Wednesday, over their efforts to block the renewal of the Patriot Act. Christie, a fellow Republican and likely presidential candidate who backs the Patriot Act, accused Lee and Paul of ""siding with"" NSA leaker Edward Snowden. a criminal, a criminal and hiding in Russia, and lecturing to us about the evils of authoritarian government, while he lives under the protective umbrella of Vladimir Putin, Christie said. who Mike Lee and Rand Paul are siding with with Edward Snowden? Come on. The beef between the senators and Christie has been growing for some time. Christie had told supporters in New Hampshire that you enjoy our civil liberties if in a coffin. Lee later told CNN he found the remark really disappointing and it reflected governing by fear and governing by false choice. He also said Christie should be ashamed of himself. The feud with Lee and Paul, a declared presidential candidate, comes as Congress is stuck on what to do about expiring NSA surveillance programs. Lee backs an alternative to the Patriot Act called the USA Freedom Act. The House-passed bill aims to limit bulk collection of metadata on American citizens. But neither that, nor a straight, short-term extension of the Patriot Act, was able to advance in the Senate before lawmakers left on the holiday break. The data collection program is set to expire at the end of the month. During his interview on Fox News, Christie also blasted President strategy in the Middle East citing the Islamic growing influence, as well as Syrian President Bashar Assad's. If a President Christie had drawn a red line in Syria, the United Sates would have gone after Assad as promised, he said. Christie also criticized Obama for not being aggressive enough bringing together allies in the Middle East. They need American support and American leadership and American strategic vision, this president put it out there, this is the guy who called them the JV, Christie said.

Speaking at Ali's funeral in Louisville, Kentucky, Hatch said the two met 28 years ago when an assistant told him he had a visitor in his Senate office. The two bonded over their love of boxing, as Hatch was once an amateur boxer. ""I was very surprised that it was none other than the champion,"" Hatch said. ""The friendship we developed, I think it was puzzling to many people -- especially those who saw only our differences."" ""But where others saw difference, Ali and I saw kinship,"" he added. The two men shared humble childhoods in working-class cities, a high value of family and deep devotions to their faiths. Hatch said these things were the foundation of ""a rich and meaningful relationship.""

3020|"State parties can reduce polarization and improve the political system | Institution"|Amid dizzying chaos in presidential politics (at least on the Republican side) and seemingly intractable dysfunction in Washington, tempting to conclude that stabilizing influences are nowhere to be found. But that be true. Hidden in plain view, state parties continue to play a critical and distinctive role in politics, and strengthening them is an achievable way to improve the functioning of the political system. That is what Raymond J. La Raja (a political scientist with the University of Massachusetts at Amherst) and I conclude in a new Brookings report. In The State of State Parties, the two of us, along with U-Mass (Amherst) researcher Samuel VanSant Stoddard, looked up-close and in detail at the condition of state party committees, surveying all 100 of them (56 responded) and interviewing 15 of their leaders. We also compared our findings with earlier surveys, gathered national data, and interviewed national-level party officials. Our main conclusions: Beyond its conclusions, our report provides a rich account of what state parties are doing and how well doing it in the real world. The findings are data driven and complemented with rich quotations and stories. The disorganization of American politics is a generational problem that will take years to sort out. Being political realists, La Raja and I believe reforms need to be gradualist and doable, and they need to cut with, rather than against, the grain of everyday political incentives. State parties have been overlooked for too long, and they offer fertile ground for practical and attainable solutions for the growing dysfunction in American politics.|2022-10-01 09:00:00|REAL|Alexander Lee|Press Pulse|744295|86441|315|7131|United States|English|2022-09-25 12:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|2599200|2091600|1635|5.25

3042|Where’s the partisan polarization on abortion?|The recent murders at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood center, and the political arguments that have followed, remind us once again of the connection between political polarization and terrorism. We are used to the idea that Democrats support legal abortion while Republicans oppose it, but this has not always been the case. This came up here a couple of years ago, but I think worth returning to the topic now that it is in the news again. To start with, the trend in public opinion from the National Election Study. For each election year we show the average opinion on abortion on 1-4 scale (where 1 = abortion should never be legal, and 4 = abortion should always be legal) among self-declared Democrats, Independents, and Republicans: I made the graph a few years ago, but I think the polarization has gone away. Sample sizes are small in some years, so I recommend trying to interpret every jump in those lines, but the basic pattern is clear: no partisan polarization on abortion before 1992, lots since. Yair Ghitza and I then broke these data down by ethnicity to see where the polarization was happening. And what we found: These lines show estimated regression coefficients predicting abortion attitude from partisanship (that is, predicting that response on the 1-to-4 scale from a party-identification variable that takes on the values -1, 0, 1 for Republicans, Independents, and Democrats), using a hierarchical model to get stable estimates for each year and for each of four ethnic groups. As you can see, almost all the polarization is occurring among whites. (Also some among the other category, but they represent only a small fraction of the electorate.) We then continued and broke down the whites by income and education: Polarization is concentrated among upper-income and well-educated whites. And now we can return to the news story about the killer: This is N=1, and of course non-college-educated people can perpetrate political violence as well. But I find the statistics helpful in understanding partisan polarization more generally.|2022-09-14 08:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Urban News|762962|22957|158|7871|Algeria|English|2022-09-10 19:00:00|Editorial|1|True|1126800|820800|2068|2.6333333333333333

The first is rising great sorting, as he called over a period of decades, has driven white conservatives out of the Democratic Party and moderates out of the Republican Party, creating two ideologically homogeneous political organizations. This is quite a belated discovery of well-established finding in political science. As noted before, the Obama administration has been remarkably slow to understand the nature and origins of our polarized politics. a new resource on that subject. pleased to announce the first book based on content from The Monkey Cage: Political Polarization in American Politics. The book is based on the many contributions to our series on American political polarization in January-February 2014, and edited by Dan Hopkins and me. As Dan and I write in the introduction: The result is a collection of pieces from leading experts on polarization that cover nearly every facet of the issue: how American politics became more polarized over time, how much that trend is manifest in different places (Congress, state legislatures, activists, and citizens), what factors are driving that trend, and what reforms might mitigate it. These pieces puncture some of the myths that frequently appear in casual punditry about as the notion that mostly driven by politicians who simply like each other, or that we can blame it primarily on partisan news media. Instead, polarization has deeper structural and historical roots. Indeed, it may even be the norm in American politics. As such, there are no easy none as easy as having politicians sit down to dinner with each other. Below is a list of the chapters and contributors.

3078|The 1 chart that explains everything you need to know about partisanship in America|"While paging through Pew's best data visualizations of 2014 (it's awesome), I came across what I believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of American politics. Here it is: The chart, which comes from Pew's amazing political polarization project, shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselves and increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last 20 years. As recently as 1994, seven in 10 Democrats were more consistently liberal than the median Republican. As of 2014, it's a whopping 94 percent. Same goes for Republicans; 64 percent of GOPers were more consistently conservative than the median Democrat in 1994 while 92 percent are today. In addition, ""the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent,"" according to Pew. To me, this chart is so important -- particularly in a week where a new Congress arrives in Washington -- because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isn't some sort of ""only in Washington"" thing. The increasing partisanship of Congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country. After all, that's who elects these people to Congress, right? So, when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in Washington, don't believe it. We have the Congress we want -- even if we aren't totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is. And, we get the results -- not many -- from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours."|2022-10-02 04:00:00|REAL|Owen Rodriguez|Times Today|834785|96689|160|7138|Philippines|English|2022-09-25 07:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|2667600|2073600|1690|2.6666666666666665
3081|Us vs Them: When Politics is Treated Like a Football Game, No One Wins|A collaborative effort between Patrick Miller of the University of Kansas and Pamela Johnston Conover of the University North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers new insight into the growing phenomenon behind political polarization in the United States. The study, titled Red and Blue States of Mind: Partisan Hostility and Voting in the United States, was published in Political Research Quarterly on March 30. When Only Partisan Voters Vote, Only Partisan Candidates Are Elected The authors argue that the voters who are most likely to participate in elections are those who hold a very strong partisan identity. As a result, elections become less about substance, and more reminiscent of a sports game, where the goal is to win at any cost. The University of Kansas news service summed up the study, saying: They found that many average voters with strong party commitments both Democrats and Republicans care more about their parties simply winning the election than they do either ideology or issues. Unlike previous research, the study found that loyalty to the party itself was the source of partisan rivalry and incivility, instead of a fundamental disagreement over issues. The trend toward greater polarization within the American electorate has been happening for years, but the contributing factors are numerous and complex A study by Pew Research shows polarization has steadily increased since 2002. Miller and study examined a few possible causes, one of which was the tendency for partisans to consume only media content that reinforces their own worldview. In a video, Miller explained that these tendencies are having an impact on Congress itself by stifling compromise and breeding a political environment that lacks civility. not thinking about politics in the way that most Founders wanted, which is to think about issues, be open to compromise and not be attached to parties, said Miller. looking at politics through a simplistic partisan view in which we think our side is good and their side is bad.

Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans. ""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience -- and in a free society, the answer is 'no.' Last year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Obama administration could not require closely held corporations to provide insurance coverage of contraception to employees if the employers objected on religious grounds. Bush converted to Catholicism -- his wife's religion -- two decades ago following a tense period in his marriage. Bush has said in the past that he believes the faith of leaders should shape their decision-making. ""[S]ome moral standards are universal. They do not bend under the weight of cultural differences or elite opinion. Wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life, and we say it with love,"" Bush said on Saturday.

The Vatican said Thursday that it has accepted a report on the overhaul of the LCWR ""marking the conclusion of the Doctrinal Assessment"" of the umbrella group. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli tells our Newscast unit the unexpected announcement is seen as a sign of Pope Francis' focus on a more merciful church. LCWR leaders met with Pope Francis later Thursday, during their annual visit to Rome. David Gibson of Religion News Service described the meeting as ""another indicator of the thaw in relations."" He added: The Rev. James Martin, SJ., editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, said in a Facebook post that the LCWR agreed to implement some changes, ""mainly regarding speakers and liturgies at its annual conventions. But overall, the operations of the LCWR remains intact."" Joshua J. McElwee, writing in the National Catholic Reporter, said the ""news seems to bring to an end what had been an especially contentious period between the women religious and the Vatican."" At issue was an investigation of the LCWR that began in 2012 under Cardinal William Levada, the previous head of the Vatican's theological watchdog. As NPR's Scott Neuman reported at the time, ""the Vatican issued a report declaring that the umbrella group representing most American nuns had strayed from church doctrine and adopted 'radical feminist' views. Rome ordered Seattle's archbishop to begin monitoring all operations of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious."" The investigation called for a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the group. Sister Simone Campbell, head of the Catholic social justice lobby Network, told NPR at the time that the investigation came ""like a sock in the stomach.""

3151|Man burned by fajitas while praying can't sue Applebee's|"WESTAMPTON, N.J. A man who leaned over a plate of sizzling fajitas to pray can't sue a Westampton restaurant because the dish burned him, an appellate court ruled Wednesday. Hiram Jimenez sought damages from Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar after a March 2010 incident at the chain's restaurant on Burlington-Mount Holly Road. But an appellate panel said Applebee's can't be held responsible because the hot food posed an ""open and obvious"" danger. According to the ruling, Jimenez ordered fajitas that were placed in front of him in a ""sizzling skillet."" When he bowed his head ""close to the table,"" the ruling says, Jimenez heard ""a loud sizzling noise, followed by 'a pop noise' and then felt a burning sensation in his left eye and on his face."" In an incident report prepared for Appelebee's, Jimenez said he was burned on his face, neck and arms after ""grease popped"" on the fajitas. His lawsuit said a waitress did not warn Jimenez that the dish was hot. It argued Jimenez suffered ""serious and permanent"" injuries ""solely as a result of (Applebee's) negligence when he came in contact with a dangerous and hazardous condition, specifically, 'a plate of hot food'."" A trial judge dismissed the suit, finding Applebee's a California-based chain with more than 1,900 restaurants was not required to warn Jimenez ""against a danger that is open and obvious."" Jimenez appealed, but a two-judge panel came to the same conclusion. It noted business owners are required to ""discover and eliminate dangerous conditions, to maintain the premises in safe condition and to avoid creating conditions that would render the premises unsafe."" But it said the risk posed by the hot platter was ""self-evident."" Applebee's, the ruling said, ""had no duty to warn (Jimenez) that the food was sizzling hot and should be approached with due care."" An attorney for Jimenez, Richard Wiener of Conshohocken, declined to comment. A lawyer for Applebee's could not be reached."|2022-10-01 06:00:00|REAL|William Kumar|The Pulse|134388|83764|368|1666|Nigeria|English|2022-09-04 23:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|2588400|316800|1960|6.133333333333334
3154|Mormon Church Backs LGBT Protection|In a landmark move, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Tuesday that it is changing its posture toward gays. The church has decided to support anti-discrimination legislation for gays and lesbians in the realm of housing and employment. The church also announced that it it comes with the condition that no one can be forced to perform actions if he or she has religious objections. One example, a doctor who refuses to artificially inseminate a lesbian couple. Utah is facing two bills that protections for each group. Political watchers in the state have noted that both measures would be likely to pass if the LDS Church got behind it. When religious people are publicly intimidated, retaliated against, forced from employment or made to suffer personal loss because they have raised their voice in the public square, donated to a cause, or participated in an election, our democracy is the loser, said Elder Dallin Oaks, a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. Such tactics are every bit as wrong as denying access to employment, housing, or public services because of race or gender. However, this month, the church was in hot water for planning to excommunicate a prominent critic of its same-sex marriage stance for the apostasy.|2022-10-05 22:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|Insider Insights|839616|19509|140|1241|Tanzania|English|2022-09-14 08:00:00|Reseña|0|True|2991600|1126800|1261|2.3333333333333335
3169|RNC Chair urges against changing convention rules before Cleveland|"WASHINGTON Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is urging his colleagues not to recommend any changes to convention rules, leaving it to the convention delegates to address controversies swirling around the party's nominating process. As drafted for the 2012 Republican convention, the RNC rules would limit the number of candidates who can be considered for the nomination at the convention. Only Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would qualify under the existing rules, but there have been a variety of suggestions for changing the rules to allow other candidates to be considered at the July Republican convention. Ohio Gov. John Kasich would need a rules change to win the nomination. The RNC rules committee will meet this week in Florida, but Priebus said on CNN's State of the Union that he is urging rules committee members not to tinker with the convention rules. ""I don't think that it's a good idea for us next week - before the convention - to make serious rules changes or recommendations of changes right now,"" Priebus said. ""I think we are in a politically charges environment, I think its too complicated, I think that the RNC rules committee going forward with making rules amendment suggestions it is not a good idea."" Priebus emphasized that the convention will have its own rules committee that will propose rules for the convention and the full convention must vote to adopt the rules. The RNC ""can't actually change anything. Its up to the delegates at the convention. So the recommendations I think just confuse people, I think its a bad idea and the environment, I think, is not conducive to it."|2022-09-21 20:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|Global Gazette|913873|40294|458|2904|Japan|English|2022-09-03 00:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|0|True|1774800|147600|1628|7.633333333333334
3172|The Libertarian Moment Is So Over That Libertarians Are Now The Single Largest Group: Gallup|"Yeah, yeah, with the rise of Der Trumper and the ascendance of Ted Cruz to serious candidacy, the Libertarian Moment is deader than Nancy Reagan's dream of a drug-free America. Right? In fact, as Cato's David Boaz has pointed out recently, the libertarian electorate is on the rise, according to Gallup's annual Governance survey from last fall. Gallup uses two questions to separate respondents into one of four categories: conservative, liberal, libertarian, and populist. The two questions are: Gallup finds that libertarian voters (those who think the government is doing too much and should NOT favor any particular set of values) account for 27 percent of respondents, followed by conservatives (26 percent), liberals (23 percent), and populists (15 percent). Boaz notes that 27 percent is the highest percentage recorded for libertarian sensibilities. In 2000, for instance, the figure was just 18 percent. So if libertarian sentiments are on the rise, then why are characters such as Trump, Cruz, and even Bernie Sanders doing so well? Boaz runs through various reasons, many of which involve the simple fact that neither the Republican nor Democratic Party does a decent job of representing libertarian values. If you take the two questions above equally serious, for instance, you couldn't in good conscience vote for any of the candidates running for president. And so we find ourselves in a situation where across many policy questions that define immigration, say, or legalizing pot and gay marriage, deregulating business, and liberalizing gun country is becoming more and more libertarian even as the major political parties get more and more reactionary in their views. As the Republican Party begins its great implosion (thank you for that, at least, Donald Trump), the question in front of us isn't why hasn't the GOP ever been as libertarian as its rhetoric (40 years ago, for god's sake, Ronald Reagan famously told Reason, ""I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism""). It's whether the Republican Party will reconstitute itself along libertarian lines. If the party elders are serious about taking the party into the future, or even dragging it in the near-present, they should be breaking toward what Reason, founded in 1968, was calling ""Free Minds and Free Markets"" back when Reagan was still in his first term as governor of California."|2022-10-08 15:00:00|REAL|Xavier Chang|Star Sentinel|805421|18190|161|7817|Tanzania|English|2022-09-07 04:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|3225600|507600|2387|2.683333333333333

3185|Defiant Paul says he can still grow GOP|"Since launching his 2016 presidential campaign, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul has paid particular attention to traditionally left-leaning demographics. Paul was the first White House hopeful to appear on Snapchat, a social app used by millions of Millennials; the first to launch an initiative focused solely on soon-to-be or newly eligible voters, setting up more than 300 ""Students for Rand"" college chapters in just 30 days; and the first to host a fundraiser with leaders in the cannabis industry. ""In the last go around, President Obama won the youth vote 3-to-1,"" Paul said Wednesday during an interview with the Washington Examiner. He went on, while fidgeting with a stack of sticky notes in the third-floor office of his campaign headquarters. ""I think we sometimes seem to be the stodgy party, with balanced budgets, low taxes and less regulations. But when you talk to young people, they're like: 'I don't have any money.' So taxes and regulatory issues aren't as big a deal for them."" ""The [National Security Agency] overreach and government overreach gives us a unique opportunity to be one of the leaders in opposing that program and actually getting things to go our way,"" Paul said when asked what messages he's using to cultivate support among young Americans."|2022-09-23 22:00:00|REAL|Michael Sharma|Newsflash|13581|8786|88|6202|India|English|2022-09-13 11:00:00|Carta al editor|1|True|1954800|1051200|1282|1.4666666666666666
3191|Poll: Las Vegas debate doesn't scramble GOP field|Donald Trump still holds a wide lead over the rest of the field, earning the support of 39% in a Fox News poll released Friday . His closest competitor, Ted Cruz, has 18%, Marco Rubio is at 11% and Ben Carson checks in with 9%. The rest of the Republican field has 3% support or less. The survey, fielded Wednesday and Thursday, largely syncs with other recent national surveys, showing Trump with a large double-digit lead over Cruz and the rest of the field lagging behind that quartet. Compared to the last Fox poll, taken in the wake of the Paris terrorism attacks, Trump has surged 11 points. He has similarly gained in other national polls amid increased terrorism fears. Trump has since called for banning all Muslims from entering the U.S., a policy that seven in 10 Republicans say they support. Two-thirds of Republicans now say they see Trump as a serious candidate (65%), a reversal from June when nearly that many described Trump as a sideshow (64%) rather than a serious candidate. Despite his dominance in the GOP race, Trump lags 11 points behind Clinton in a hypothetical general election matchup. Other Republicans fare better against the Democratic front-runner, but still, 47% of GOP primary voters think Trump is their best shot to beat Clinton.|2022-10-05 22:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Evening Echo|553135|53123|306|4900|Kenya|English|2022-09-23 20:00:00|Reseña|1|True|2991600|1947600|1266|5.1

The prime-time debate will actually be split into two parts: One with the candidates that national polls rank as the top 10 GOP contenders, and one with the candidates who didn't make that cut. The broad GOP field has presented a challenge for both Fox News and CNN as debate hosts. Fox News announced a plan for an August 6 debate that would only include the 10 candidates that were at the top of the heap, as determined by an average of national polls. Fox's proposed criteria created the most consternation, partly because it is hosting the first debate, partly because it is a favorite of conservatives, and partly because its rules are more restrictive than CNN's. Some Republican Party leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire have said they feel the use of national polls stomps on their roles as the first in the nation caucus and primary states, respectively. Tapper announced that he'll moderate the debate on Sunday, at the end of his first show as CNN's new ""State of the Union"" host."|2022-10-10 04:00:00|REAL|Olivia Kumar|The Pulse|388419|93304|230|1540|India|English|2022-09-29 06:00:00|Artículo de investigación|0|True|2415600|3358800|1183|3.8333333333333335
3211|The 2016 Republican field might be the most diverse ever — for either party|"The addition of Carly Fiorina (not a white man) and Ben Carson (not a white man) to a Republican 2016 field that already includes Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul means that the 2016 Republican field will likely be the most diverse from either party since at least 1992. Given how the country has diversified -- and given how many non-white-men are already in the GOP field -- it's likely that the current class is the most diverse ever. With one caveat. We pulled data on the major presidential contenders from each election since Bill Clinton first won the presidency. What constitutes a presidential contender is admittedly subjective, so we focused (but not exclusively) on those who actually made it onto ballots and those who won delegates. Giving us this: For 2016, we included a number of people who aren't yet actual candidates, including Martin O'Malley on the Democratic side and Republicans Scott Walker, Rick Perry, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal. (Why didn't we include Trump? Because: Who is that? Who is ""Trump""? Also.) Those likely candidates are the faded icons on the chart below. Even once we add in all of those mostly white-male Republican maybes, the party's 2016 field is the most diverse on either side. One more white male, though, and the balance tips to the 2008 Democrats, with Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Richardson in a smaller field. (In terms of the sheer number of non-white men, the giant 2016 GOP field will be hard to beat.) There's only one non-white woman on our chart: 2004 Democrat Carol Moseley Braun. Since 1990, the percentage of the country that is white has dropped from more than 80 percent to just above 70 percent, according to Census Bureau data. That increased diversity is reflected in the candidates that the parties field. We'll note, though, that the percentage of women in America has always been a bit above 50 percent, but the percentage of women that have run for president since 1992 has been below 10 percent. Which is something that at least one of this year's candidates will probably point out."|2022-09-21 21:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Daily Beacon|675275|50625|156|17|South Africa|English|2022-09-08 12:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|1778400|622800|2111|2.6

3220|Republicans Are Now Seen As The More Extreme Party|In a shift of opinion since the 2014 midterms, Americans now consider the Republican Party more extreme than the Democratic Party, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds. In the days just after the GOP retook the Senate last November, Americans were evenly split as to which party they thought was more extreme. They now say by an 8-point margin that Republicans are further from the mainstream. Half of Americans now say the GOP is too extreme, up 7 points since November. The percentage saying Democrats are too extreme, which has remained relatively steady, is currently 39 percent. Forty-eight percent of independents now say the GOP is too extreme, up 9 points from last year. The percentage of Republicans calling their own party too extreme also rose by 6 points. One thing hasn't changed: Most Americans still want members of both parties to work together. Fifty-six percent say that Republicans should compromise some of their positions to work with Democrats, rather than stick to their positions and risk not coming to an agreement, while 68 percent say Democrats in Congress should compromise. While most Democrats think their leaders should compromise, Republicans support a harder-edged approach, with 58 percent saying their congressional representatives should stick to their positions. Independents say that both sides should work together. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted April 25-27 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the poll's methodology are available here. Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov's reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.

3232|Polls show GOP presidential primary fight wide open|Their leads, however, are all within the margin of error, indicating a tight race in the three key early nominating states. In New Hampshire, Bush leads the pack with 18 percent support among potential Republican primary voters. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker takes 15%, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul takes 14% and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie draws 13% support. Huckabee takes 17% support from potential GOP caucus-goers in Iowa, barely edging Bush, who nabs 16% support. Walker again draws the support of 15% of respondents, while Christie takes 9% and Paul draws 7%. In South Carolina, Graham draws 17% support, while Bush takes 15% and Walker takes 12% support. Huckabee and neurosurgeon Ben Carson tie with 10% of respondents. The surveys, though early in the nominating contest, may be most troubling for Bush. They suggest despite being well-known as the son and brother of two former presidents, and though he's emerged as the preferred candidate of the GOP establishment, Bush hasn't yet convinced the party's primary voters to get on board. The South Carolina results, too, suggest even Graham's constituents are lukewarm about his presidential aspirations. On the Democratic side, the contest looks far more settled former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads the field by 45% or more in all three states. NBC and Marist did not poll the preferred candidate of progressives, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, because she's repeatedly said she won't run. The New Hampshire survey was conducted from Feb. 3-10 among 381 potential GOP primary voters and has a margin of error of 5%; the Iowa survey was conducted over the same period, among 320 potential GOP caucus-goers, and has a margin of error of 5.5%; and the South Carolina poll was conducted over the same period among 450 potential GOP primary voters and has a margin of error of 4.6%.|2022-09-28 09:00:00|REAL|Michael Sharma|Central Times|900628|46260|150|2669|Indonesia|English|2022-09-14 05:00:00|Reportaje|0|True|2340000|1116000|1852|2.5

3244|Which Republicans have come out against Boehner for speaker? Here’s a list.|"A growing group of rogue conservative House Republicans has come out against reelecting John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) for another term as speaker. So far, the list of defectors is up to nine. At least two of them have offered themselves as alternatives. To be elected speaker, Boehner must win a majority of all members -- Democrat, Republican or otherwise -- who cast votes. When the new Congress is sworn in Tuesday, there will be 246 Republicans (since Michael Grimm is resigning) and 188 Democrats for a total of 434 members. If some members don't cast votes, the threshold for clinching a win will be lowered. Boehner's office appears confident he will win.

3262|GOP Senator David Perdue Jokes About Praying for Obama’s Death|The freshman senator from Georgia quoted scripture at a right-wing Christian confab to say the president's days should be short. Sen. David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia, opened his remarks at the Faith & Freedom Road to Majority conference by encouraging attendees to pray for President Obama. But, he added in a joking tone, they need to pray for him in a very specific way: We should pray for him like Psalms 109:8 says: Let his days be few, and let another have his office, the senator said, smiling wryly. The rest of that passage, which Perdue did not recite, reads, May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes. Let the creditor seize all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor. Let there be none to extend mercy to him, nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out, it continues. joke drew immediate criticism. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, tweeted, Republican Senator David Perdue is praying for President Obama to die. This is why Trump is the GOP nominee. As the Washington Dave Weigel pointed out, conservatives have long invoked this verse in the yearning for an end to days in office. A Christian Science Monitor report from November 16, 2009, detailed the popularity of bumper stickers that read simply, Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8. The Road to Majority conference brings together top leaders in the social-conservative world, as well as prominent elected Republicans. Shortly after speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Trump adviser Sen. Jeff Sessions spoke. Donald Trump will keynote the event later today. Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that. However, we should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of.|2022-10-03 17:00:00|REAL|Isabella Nguyen|The Daily Dispatch|147371|24042|267|5252|Spain|English|2022-09-20 07:00:00|Editorial|0|True|2800800|1641600|2148|4.45

""I support Governor Sandoval's difficult decision to not run for the United States Senate,"" said Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who had urged the governor to run. ""Under his leadership, our state's economy continues to experience the Nevada comeback that we all know it is capable of achieving.

Reid has endorsed Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general, who announced her candidacy shortly after his announcement. Sandoval easily won a second term last year, and is the first Latino to serve as Nevada's governor. But he has long sounded reluctant about entering the Senate race.

The two men fitting the description of inmates David Sweat and Richard Matt were seen about a week ago in Steuben County, New York, over 300 miles southwest of Dannemora, according to a news release posted late Friday. Two men were seen walking near a rail yard in Erwin on June 13, and then seen the next day in Lindley, New York, heading toward the Pennsylvania border. Investigators conducted interviews in both communities and have surveillance video that was initially deemed inconclusive and is being sent to Albany for analysis. It clear why authorities waited a week before divulging the information. State police spokesman Beau Duffy told FoxNews.com Saturday investigators did not wait that long. He said troopers learned about the possible weekend sightings on Tuesday. He said troopers then sought to verify the sightings over the next two days. Late Friday afternoon, troopers got their hands on the surveillance video. Duffy said at that point commanders decided to release information on the possible sightings to alert the public and to hopefully generate more leads. Sweat and Matt used power tools to cut their way out of Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora on June 6. Hundreds of law enforcement officers have been looking for them. State police say prepared to keep searching for the long haul. Friday, police asked hunters for help in the search for the escaped convicts. asking them to review video from wildlife or trail cameras to see if they see anything suspicious, State Police Maj. Charles Guess said at a press conference at the prison. Hunters say they are ready to help even if it hunting season and they still haven't turned their trail cams on to track deer. State police said Friday they have searched 600 miles of trails leading out of Dannemora, but local outdoorsman Jason Langdon said the wooded area is so vast, searchers still have a lot of work to do. A correction officer from the prison was also suspended, officials announced Friday. However, officials have any other information involving the case.

3284|Harry Reid endorses Chuck Schumer to succeed him as Senate Democratic leader|"Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has endorsed Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to succeed him after he retires at the end of 2016. ""I think Schumer should be able to succeed me,"" Reid said in a Friday morning interview at his home in Washington's West End. Reid predicted that Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat in leadership and a close friend, would win the Democratic leader post without opposition. He said that the other likely contender, Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), would stand down for Schumer. Reid and Durbin spoke by phone at about 11 a.m. Friday. Reid called Schumer ""extremely smart"" and noted the brash, energetic New Yorker would have a ""different style"" than his own soft talking demeanor. Seemingly comfortable with his decision to not run for re-election, Reid said the liberal wing of the Democratic Party should have faith in Schumer, whose ties to Wall Street fueled his fundraising prowess and helped Democrats win the majority in 2006 and expand it to a super-majority in 2009. Those ties have some liberals questioning whether Schumer should lead the party, but Reid said that Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would serve as the torch bearers for the populist wing and hold the caucus's feet to the fire. Of his own decision, Reid said he did not want to win another term and grow old in office, saying he wanted to be remembered for his ""first 34 years"" in Congress and not the last few years. A devout baseball fan, Reid said he never wanted to grow old and not be a real force in the Senate. ""I don't want to be a pinch hitter,"" he said. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) released a video announcing he does not intend to run for reelection at the end of his term. Reid said his decision has nothing to do with the injuries he sustained on Jan. 1, 2015.

3294|Mitch McConnell Pledges To Avoid Debt Ceiling Disaster|"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday that despite his differences with President Barack Obama, he has no interest in shutting down the government or causing it to default on its debt. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned Congress on Friday that on March 16 the government would no longer have authority to take on debt to pay for spending Congress has already approved. If lawmakers don't raise the so-called ""debt ceiling"" by then, Lew said the Treasury Department can take ""extraordinary measures"" to continue government operations for a short time. ""I made it very clear after the November election that we're certainly not going to shut down the government or default on the national debt,"" McConnell said, speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Defaulting on the debt would not only shut down the government; economists say it could have catastrophic financial consequences. The Obama administration has previously refused to bargain with Republicans who wanted policy concessions from Democrats for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling. Nevertheless, McConnell suggested Republicans could try to get some policy initiatives out of a debt ceiling hike -- even though demands could lead to a standoff with the Obama administration. ""We'll figure some way to handle it and hopefully it might carry some other important legislation that we can agree on in connection with it,"" McConnell said."|2022-10-08 03:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Echo News|841943|99203|338|4486|Philippines|English|2022-09-10 20:00:00|Carta al editor|1|True|3182400|824400|1423|5.633333333333334
3302|Senate Advances Bill To Approve Keystone Pipeline Despite Obama's Veto Threat|"WASHINGTON -- The Senate advanced legislation Monday night to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, even though President Barack Obama has already said he would veto it. The Senate voted 63-32 to clear a procedural hurdle and begin debate on the bill. Ten Democrats and one independent, Angus King (Maine), voted with every Republican to move the bill forward. Those Democrats included Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Tom Udall (N.M.) and Mark Warner (Va.). A final vote is expected later this week. Despite the strong vote, the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority vote needed to overcome a veto. The House passed the bill last week by a vote of 266 to 153 -- also shy of the 290 votes needed to clear a veto. Congressional action on Keystone comes after the Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the proposed pipeline's route through the state. The Obama administration had been waiting for the Nebraska ruling to render its own decision on the pipeline, which is still forthcoming. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday that the State Department is examining the court's decision as part of its process to evaluate whether the Keystone XL Pipeline project serves the national interest. ""As we have made clear, we are going to let that process play out,"" Schultz said. ""Regardless of the Nebraska ruling today, the House bill still conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests, and if presented to the President, he will veto the bill.""

3303|The Senate's 46 Democrats got 20 million more votes than its 54 Republicans|"On Tuesday, 33 US senators elected in November will be sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden including 12 who are new to the chamber. The class includes 22 Republicans and 11 Democrats, a big reason why the GOP has a 54-46 majority in the Senate overall. But here's a crazy fact: those 46 Democrats got more votes than the 54 Republicans across the 2010, 2012, and 2014 elections. According to Nathan Nicholson, a researcher at the voting reform advocacy group FairVote, ""the 46 Democratic caucus members in the 114th Congress received a total of 67.8 million votes in winning their seats, while the 54 Republican caucus members received 47.1 million votes."" Here's what that looks like in chart form: This doesn't mean that the Republican majority is illegitimate or anything like that. Indeed, after 2008 and 2012, the tables were turned: Democrats got more Senate seats than their vote share suggested they should. The problem isn't that the deck is stacked in favor of Republicans. The problem is that the deck is stacked in favor of small states, which receive equal representation in the Senate despite dramatic variance in population. The Senate is a profoundly anti-democratic body and should be abolished."|2022-09-20 04:00:00|REAL|Gabriel Santos|Morning Star|734166|78041|798|9595|Philippines|English|2022-09-13 20:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|1083600|1630800|1213|13.3

3316|VFW fires back at Obama: Politics not 'confused'|The largest veterans group hit back at President Obama on Thursday and urged him not to denigrate their intelligence after the president suggested their members were easily swayed by cable news and right-wing radio. The Veterans of Foreign Wars called out the president after Obama referenced the political opinions at VFW halls in an Indiana speech Wednesday that toggled between campaign politics and the economy. I know how many VFW Posts the president has ever visited, but our near 1.7 million members are a direct reflection of America, VFW National Commander John A. Biedrzycki Jr. said in a statement. We have confused politics, we need left or rightwing media filters telling us how to think or vote, and we need any President of the United States lecturing us about how we are individually [affected] by the economy. Obama, speaking in Elkhart, Ind., had lamented the primary story he claimed Republicans are telling about the economy one that focuses on how moochers at the bottom of the income ladder are squeezing middle-class families. We have been hearing this story for decades, Obama said. Tales about welfare queens, talking about takers, talking about the It's the story that is broadcast every day on some cable news stations, on right-wing radio, it's pumped into cars, and bars, and VFW halls all across America, and right here in Elkhart. Obama continued: And if you're hearing that story all the time, you start believing it. It's no wonder people think big government is the problem. Biedrzycki suggested veterans are not so easily swayed. Our nation was created and continues to exist solely because of the men and women who wear the uniform, he said. not denigrate their service, their sacrifice or their intelligence. Obama is no stranger to the VFW, having addressed the national convention several times dating back to his first presidential campaign. He last spoke to the VFW convention last July in Pittsburgh, calling the occasion a great honor. He used the speech to address ongoing efforts to help veterans, especially in the area of health care, in the wake of the Veterans Affairs wait-times scandal. As president, I consider it my obligation to help make sure that, even though less than 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform, that 100 percent of Americans honor your sacrifices and your service, he said.|2022-09-29 22:00:00|REAL|Isabella Nguyen|City Beat|157274|61237|512|9618|Russia|English|2022-09-15 11:00:00|Análisis|1|True|2473200|1224000|2345|8.533333333333333
3323|VA secretary asks Iraq War veteran: 'What have you done?'|"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald on Wednesday asked a Republican lawmaker who served in both Iraq wars, ""What have you done?"" as the two men sparred over huge cost overruns at a troubled Denver VA hospital. McDonald was defending the VA's budget at a hearing when he and Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman tussled over construction delays and cost increases at the long-delayed hospital project. After a few minutes of arguing, McDonald snapped at Coffman: ""I've run a large company, sir. What have you done?"" Coffman, an Army veteran, did not respond at the hearing. But the four-term lawmaker said in a statement later that he could tell McDonald a few things he hasn't done. ""I have never run a federal agency that tolerates corruption the way the VA has. I've never built a hospital that's years behind schedule and hundreds of millions over budget. And I've never been a shill for inept bureaucrats who allowed American heroes to die on a medical waiting list,"" he said. The last comment was a reference to a wait-time scandal that cost former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki his job. McDonald, a former Procter & Gamble CEO, took over as VA secretary in July. He has vowed to improve VA's delivery of services such as health care and disability benefits and make it a ""model"" for other government agencies. The dust-up started when Coffman criticized the VA for citing its legal efforts to defend the Denver hospital project as a major accomplishment. ""How is that a success?"" Coffman asked. ""You lost that case on every single point for the hospital in my district that is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule."" ""I think that that's just characteristic of your glossing over the extraordinary problems confronted by your department,"" Coffman added. ""This is a department mired in bureaucratic incompetence and corruption."" McDonald said he was offended by Coffman's remarks and noted that he had only been on the job for six months. ""You've been here longer than I have. If there's a problem in Denver, I think you own it more than I do,"" he told Coffman. McDonald then offered to give Coffman his cellphone, ""and you can answer some of the calls and see if I'm making a difference for veterans."|2022-10-04 17:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Echo News|549389|21066|151|3407|Turkey|English|2022-09-06 12:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|0|True|450000|2887200|2232|2.5166666666666666

3326|State Department warns of possible terror attack in South Africa|"WASHINGTON The State Department on Saturday warned American citizens in South Africa of the imminent threat of terrorist attacks. The warning, issued by the U.S. Diplomatic Mission to South Africa, states that the government has received information that terrorist groups are planning to carry out ""near-term attacks against places where U.S. citizens congregate in South Africa, such as upscale shopping areas and malls in Johannesburg and Cape Town."" The warning refers to the public call by the Islamic State, or ISIL, to conduct terrorist strikes during the coming month of Ramadan. The State Department has issued similar warnings to U.S. citizens living or traveling in Europe, saying credible information exists about ISIL militants planning attacks there. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that it had conducted several strikes some of them kept secret until now against Islamic extremists outside of Iraq and Syria as the military widens its attacks on militants. In 2016 alone, U.S. attacks in Yemen have killed more than 100 militants, according to U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East. The most recent airstrike against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula occurred on May 19 in central Yemen and killed four al-Qaeda operatives. It was the ninth attack in Yemen this year, including several the military had announced since March. Central Command also confirmed three previously unannounced attacks in Yemen. Strikes on Feb. 3, Feb. 29 and March 30 killed 11 al-Qaeda fighters The military didn't disclose those attacks immediately in order to confuse militants and act swiftly on intelligence gathered at the sites, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, a Central Command spokesman, told reporters on Friday. Sometimes the chatter that comes after a strike allows us to collect more intelligence on adversaries to conduct future strikes, Ryder said. Meantime, in Iraq and Syria, the U.S.-led coalition continued to attack ISIL, hitting 25 targets, the military command in Baghdad announced Saturday. Those attacks came as Syrian troops advanced on Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of ISIL, and the suicide bombers struck in Iraq, killing 15 people in and around Baghdad."|2022-09-09 12:00:00|REAL|Zoe Lee|The Insight|980498|8572|53|4726|South Africa|English|2022-09-06 23:00:00|Crónica|0|True|489600|709200|2205|0.8833333333333333
3339|Top Clinton aide Mills reportedly walks out of FBI interview about emails|"Senior Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and her lawyer walked out of a recent interview with the FBI about Clinton's private email system after an investigator asked a question Mills believed to be off limits, according to a published report. The Washington Post said that Mills and her lawyer, Beth Wilkinson, returned to the interview room after a brief absence. However, the Post reported that Mills and Wilkinson asked for breaks during the interview to confer more than once. According to the paper, the FBI investigator's questions that caused Mills and Wilkinson to walk out were related to the procedure used to produce emails for possible public release by the State Department. Mills ultimately did not answer questions about it because her attorney and Justice Department prosecutors deemed it confidential under attorney-client privilege. The FBI is currently investigating possible gross mishandling of classified information and Clinton's use of an unsecured personal account exclusively for government business. Investigators have already interviewed two of Clinton's top aides, Mills and Huma Abedin, and hope to be able to interview Clinton herself as they wrap up the case. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that she had not yet been contacted by the FBI to arrange an interview. On Tuesday, the conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch said it had obtained emails showing that a top Clinton political aide pushed the State Department to hire Bryan Pagliano, who helped manage Clinton's personal email server. The emails show that State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy, a key figure in the Benghazi investigation, was involved in Pagliano's hire. The emails also appear to show members of the State Department's IT division questioning why Pagliano, a political appointee who had worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, would be assigned to that office. ""[Kennedy] specifically said we didn't need to be [political appointees], but it sure sounds like we do,"" one email reads. In court documents made public Monday, the State Department said it could not find any emails sent to or received by Pagliano during Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, which lasted between 2009 and 2013.

3358|Top House Republican demands Kerry explain $1.7 billion Iran payment|"The chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee demanded Wednesday that Secretary of State John Kerry explain a $1.7 billion settlement paid to Iran that some Republicans have described as a ""ransom"" tied to last month's release of five American prisoners. Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., complained in a letter to Kerry that his committee was not consulted about the payment. The Obama administration claimed the agreement was made to settle a dispute with Iran over $400 million in frozen funds that dated back to 1979. The remaining $1.3 billion was described by the Obama administration as ""interest"". ""It is unclear how this $1.7 billion payment is in the national security interests of the United States,"" Royce wrote. Royce's letter included 10 questions to Kerry about the settlement. Among them are how the administration calculated the $1.3 billion ""interest"" on the payment, a timeline of negotiations over the payment since this past summer's nuclear deal, and why the money was not used to ""compensate American victims of Iranian terrorism who have been awarded judgments against Iran."" Royce's letter also asks for a list of U.S. officials who participated in negotiations with Iran over the payment, the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement. The White House announced the payment on Jan. 17, the same day that Iran released five American prisoners, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former Marine Amir Hekmati, and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini. At the time, Obama defended the amount paid by the U.S., saying it was ""much less than the amount Iran sought."" The president added that the one-time payment was preferable to letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a judgement from the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, which is based in The Hague and was created in the deal that ended the Iran hostage crisis in 1981. ""I have a larger concern that in choosing to resolve this relatively minor bilateral dispute at this time, the Obama Administration is aggressively moving towards reestablishing diplomatic relations with Iran,"" Royce wrote. ""Such action would clearly violate the pledge to 'remain vigilant' in countering the threat Iran poses to the United States and our allies in the region."" State Department spokesman John Kirby confirmed to Reuters that Royce's letter had been received. ""As with all Congressional correspondence, we'll respond as appropriate,"" Kirby said.

3380|Gowdy reveals subpoena Clinton claims she 'never had'|"House Republicans investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on Wednesday released a March subpoena issued to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, one day after she said in a nationally televised interview that she ""never had a subpoena"" in the email controversy. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the Benghazi panel, said he had ""no choice"" but to make the subpoena public ""in order to correct the inaccuracy"" of Clinton's claim. Clinton told CNN on Monday that she ""never had a subpoena,"" adding: ""Everything I did was permitted by law and regulation."" Gowdy said the committee issued the March 4 subpoena to Clinton personally after learning the full extent of her use of private emails while serving as secretary of state. Regardless of whether a subpoena was issued, ""Secretary Clinton had a statutory duty to preserve records from her entire time in office, and she had a legal duty to cooperate with and tell the truth to congressional investigators requesting her records going back to September of 2012,"" Gowdy said in a statement. The dispute over the subpoena is the latest flashpoint in an increasingly partisan investigation by the House panel, which was created to probe the September 2012 attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Gowdy and other Republicans have complained that Clinton and the State Department have not been forthcoming with release of her emails and note that the State Department has said it cannot find in its records all or part of 15 work-related emails from Clinton's private server. The emails all pre-date the assault on the U.S. diplomatic facility and consist mainly of would-be intelligence reports passed to Clinton by longtime political confidant Sidney Blumenthal, officials said. Gowdy has said the missing emails raise ""serious questions"" about Clinton's decision to erase her personal server, especially before it could be analyzed by an independent third-party arbiter. A Clinton campaign spokesman has said she turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, ""including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."|2022-10-06 15:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|The Chronicle|409282|72861|396|6944|United Kingdom|English|2022-10-02 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3052800|2728800|2155|6.6

The company then won the award in 2010 when eight of the 12 finalists and two of the three winners had donated to the foundation. The other Clinton contributor to win that year, candy-maker Mars, Inc., had given between $25,000 and $50,000. Coca-Cola was the most generous foundation donor to be honored as a finalist in 2010, giving a $5-10 million donation.|2022-10-09 13:00:00|REAL|Isabella Nguyen|The Reporter|778796|55845|182|5870|South Africa|English|2022-09-24 23:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|3304800|2044800|1013|3.033333333333333
3385|State Department won’t rule out $50B ‘signing bonus’ for Iran|"The State Department on Monday would not rule out giving Iran up to $50 billion as a so-called ""signing bonus"" for agreeing to a nuclear deal later this year, according to comments made to journalists following reports that the Obama administration had formulated a plan to release tens of billions of frozen Iranian funds. Experts have said this multi-billion dollar ""signing bonus"" option, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, could be the largest cash infusion to a terror-backing regime in recent memory. A cash release of $30 to $50 billion upon reaching a final nuclear agreement would come in addition to the more than $11 billion in unfrozen assets that Iran will already have received under an interim nuclear accord reached in 2013. When asked to address these reports on Monday, State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf attempted to dodge the issue and then accused reporters of getting ""spun up"" on the issue. Asked whether Iran could receive $50 billion ""on day one after signing"" or verbally agreeing to a nuclear deal, Harf told reporters that she would ""look into it."" When pressed to provide an answer about the Journal's initial report, Harf declined ""to go line by line in the story."" Harf said sanctions relief to Iran will continue through June 30.

3388|State Department: No record of Clinton signing 'separation' form|"The State Department said Tuesday it has no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department -- a form that was the subject of intense speculation since the issue could determine whether she broke the law. That document is known as a ""separation"" form, which officials are supposed to sign upon leaving the department. It certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all ""classified or administratively controlled"" materials, as well as all ""unclassified documents and papers"" relating to official government business. Given that Clinton exclusively used personal email while secretary of state and didn't turn over official records until late last year, a former Justice Department official said last week that if Clinton signed that form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law. But on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are ""fairly certain she did not"" sign it. ""We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form],"" Psaki said. This admission comes after the department for days was unable to answer questions about whether Clinton signed the form. It also raises questions about whether Clinton, by not signing it, at least violated department policy. Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy. Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either. She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees. Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department. If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, ""there's no question [she broke the law]."" And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, ""why not?"" The Associated Press contributed to this report."|2022-09-28 12:00:00|REAL|Samantha Chen|Insider Insights|721423|13263|8|1157|Ukraine|English|2022-09-27 15:00:00|Análisis|0|True|2350800|2275200|2283|0.13333333333333333
3389|Clinton camp issues clarification on deleted emails, claims ‘every’ message was reviewed|Hillary camp late Sunday issued a significant clarification about the steps they say were taken to review thousands of personal emails before they were deleted, claiming her team individually read every email before discarding those deemed private. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill made the clarification in a written statement to Fox News. This comes after the former secretary of office revealed last week that while more than 30,000 work-related emails were turned over to the State Department, nearly 32,000 were deemed private and deleted. This admission raised questions over how her team decided to get rid of those messages. Merrill on Sunday clarified an earlier fact sheet that described some of those methods but did not say every email was read. We simply took for granted that reading every single email came across as the most important, fundamental and exhaustive step that was performed. The fact sheet should have been clearer in stating that every email was read, Merrill said. Clinton, a likely Democratic presidential candidate, tried to tamp down the controversy over her exclusive use of personal email while secretary of state during a press conference last week. But the admission that she deleted thousands of messages, and her insistence that her personal server remain private, stirred the ire and curiosity -- of lawmakers who want greater access to her communications as secretary and complain much of it may be gone forever. Whether the assurance that every email was read before being either deleted or turned over eases those concerns remains to be seen. I have zero interest in looking at her personal emails, South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News Sunday. But who gets to decide personal and public? And if a mixed-use email, and lots of the emails we get in life are both personal and work, I just trust her lawyers to make the determination that the getting everything entitled to.|2022-10-06 17:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Times Today|972933|53417|251|4039|Kenya|English|2022-09-22 07:00:00|Columna de humor|1|True|1814400|3060000|1928|4.183333333333334

The vote ever-so-dramatically coincides with the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, as well as antiabortion annual March for Life in Washington. The House approved the broadened abortion curbs by a near party-line 242-179 vote. The White House warned that President Barack Obama would veto the measure, all but ensuring that it would never become law. The approved bill would permanently bar federal funds for any abortion coverage and block tax credits for many people and businesses buying health insurance that covers abortions.

""I can't imagine that a Republican majority Congress in a lame duck session after the American people have spoken would want to confirm a nominee opposed by the NRA, the NFIB, and the New York Times says would move the court dramatically to the left,"" McConnell said. ""This nomination ought to be made by the next president."" He also criticized Garland, arguing that opposition to his nomination from the National Rifle Association and the National Federation of Independent Businesses shows he's too liberal. Asked if he's ruling out the possibility of a lame duck confirmation entirely, McConnell said: ""Yes."" Democrats are prodding the GOP to give Garland a confirmation vote. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada called on Republicans to ""man up and do it now"" in an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" He also predicted that McConnell will back off his pledge not to give Garland a vote. ""Mitch McConnell has said a lot of things. But his Republican senators are not going to go over that cliff with him. They're not going to do it. As I told Merrick Garland, 'This is going to break. You're going to become a Supreme Court justice.' "" Reid added: ""And in addition to the people agreeing to meet, we have Republican senators and a veteran senator who said, 'Well maybe what we should do is do it in a lame duck.' Orrin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, others have said that. But if they're going to do it in lame duck, do it now."" The GOP's front-runner is currently Donald Trump -- but McConnell predicted Trump wouldn't be a drag on Republican candidates. ""All of those races will be run by candidates seeking to appeal to the voters in those states. Senate races are statewide races -- you can craft your own message for your own people,"" he said. Still, asked about the violence at Trump rallies, McConnell said candidates should encourage rally attendees to engage in ""peaceful discourse"" and that doing so ""would be a very important addition to the conversation."|2022-10-01 13:00:00|REAL|Michael Sharma|Star Sentinel|938499|21103|630|1367|Mexico|English|2022-09-22 23:00:00|Análisis|1|True|1872000|2613600|2184|10.5

""We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it."" King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he is surprised that some Republicans have decided to reject a nominee before even having a candidate to evaluate. ""I'm surprised people can make that judgment before they even know who the nominee is,"" he said. ""It may be that he picks a nominee that's so eminently qualified that it would be very hard to explain a vote against him, other than politics."" King acknowledged that the Senate doesn't have to support the nominee, but thinks there should be a vote. ""Of course, we have these debates. And of course, politics are involved,"" King said. ""The politics are important. And I'm not saying a Republican senator has to vote for whoever Obama nominates. I would never say that."" But a refusal to hold a process could leave the vacancy for more than a year and that would be ""pretty troublesome,"" King said. The senator, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also expressed concern about a judge's order that Apple help the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. ""They're asking Apple to create a key that does not currently exist. And I've got a problem with that. This is a very complicated issue,"" he said. Forcing Apple to do this could set ""a serious precedent"" that could lead to other citizens having their privacy invaded, he said. ""Once that key is made, it can end up in the hands of hackers,"" King said. ""There's no end to complications of this.""

With Scalia, the court had four reliable conservative votes and, in Justice Kennedy, the court had a conservative swing vote. That led to many decisions that were decided by a razor thin 5-to-4 margin.

3457|Supreme Court Rules Obamacare Subsidies Are Legal|"The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday handed the Obama administration a major victory on health care, ruling 6-3 that nationwide subsidies called for in the Affordable Care Act are legal. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" the court's majority said in the opinion, which was written by Chief Justice John Roberts. But they acknowledged that ""petitioners' arguments about the plain meaning ... are strong."" The majority opinion cited the law's ""more than a few examples of inartful drafting,"" but added, ""the context and structure of the Act compel us to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase."" Roberts was joined by the court's liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as by Anthony Kennedy. In his dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said: ""We should start calling this law SCOTUScare,"" an apparent reference to the fact the Supreme Court has now saved the Affordable Care Act twice. Scalia called the majority's reading of the text ""quite absurd, and the court's 21 pages of explanation make it no less so."" As NPR's Nina Totenberg reported in March, opponents of the law contended ""that the text of the law does not authorize subsidies to make mandated insurance affordable in 34 states."" At issue were six words in one section of the law. As Nina pointed out: ""Those words stipulate that for people who cannot afford health coverage, subsidies are available through 'an exchange established by the state.' "" She added: The court agreed Thursday with the government's position. The decision comes three years after a bitterly divided high court upheld the Affordable Care Act as constitutional by a 5-4 vote.

3478|Supreme Court Throws Out Ruling On Obamacare Contraception Mandate|WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out an appeals court decision that went against the University of Notre Dame over its religious objections to the Obamacare health law's contraception requirement. The justices asked the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision in favor of the Obama administration in light of the June 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the provision. The court's action means the February 2014 appeals court ruling that denied the South Bend, Indiana-based Roman Catholic university an injunction against the requirement has been wiped out. The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known widely as Obamacare, requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women including access to contraception and sterilization. In the 2014 ruling, the high court said that Hobby Lobby Stores Ltd could, on religious grounds, seek exemptions from the contraception provision. Days later, in a case similar to the Notre Dame dispute, the Supreme Court allowed a college in Illinois a temporary exemption while litigation continues. Catholic groups say they should not have to pay for or facilitate access to contraception or abortion because of religious objections. But courts that have considered the issue since then have found that a compromise aimed at nonprofits with religious affiliations, issued in 2013 and amended in August 2014, did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling. The compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab. Notre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement. The case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.

3483|House Republicans say IRS should blame itself for rough tax season|It was a tough tax season for the Internal Revenue Service, but GOP lawmakers in Congress says the agency only has itself to blame. Last month, IRS commissioner John Koskinen said that years of budget cuts and staffing losses had led to abysmal customer service from his agency. But Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee say the financial problems stem from bad budgeting decisions, employee bonuses, and overspending on administrative costs. The spending decisions have real consequences for taxpayers, the GOP representatives said in a report on Wednesday. Wasteful spending and failure to prioritize taxpayer assistance led to millions of calls going unanswered for filing season 2015. [In the IRS help line, dejection is standard] Committee Republicans found that the IRS spent $60 million on employee bonuses in 2014, an amount they said could have been used to field over 7 million customer calls. The report also points to a $134 million cut in user fees allocated to customer support as another area where the IRS could have better utilized its already tight budget. There is no denying that the agency budget has shrunk lately, with Congress cutting the IRS budget by more than $1 billion over the past five years. But the report found that the agency has reduced spending on customer service. The IRS has the authority to decide how it spends some revenue from user fees that the agency collects. The amount of discretionary funds available to the IRS increased from $310 million in 2010 to $481 million in fiscal year 2015, but total funding for taxpayer assistance fell by 6 percent, according to the report. In 2011, the agency spent $129 million on taxpayer services and $79 million on operations support. In 2015, taxpayer services funding was scheduled to drop to $49 million while support funds were set for $411 million. Committee Republicans argued that that shift in priorities could have been avoided. Koskinen predicted the tax year would be difficult for taxpayers and IRS employees alike as early as January, when he wrote a bleak warning letter to agency employees. This year we are looking at a situation where realistically we have no choice but to do less with less, he wrote. The result was a tax season riddled with confusion and long lines like those revealed in a Washington Post article this month. Koskinen is scheduled to testify before the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday about the 2015 tax filing season and IRS operations.|2022-09-24 23:00:00|REAL|Samantha Chen|Voice of the Nation|810334|4074|471|9044|Argentina|English|2022-09-03 21:00:00|Artículo de opinión|1|True|2044800|223200|2478|7.85

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) teamed up on Wednesday with GOP colleague Mike Lee (R-Utah) to unveil a comprehensive set of proposals to overhaul the tax code. ""Our hope here isn't to pick winners and losers. Our hope here is to trigger economic growth,"" Rubio told reporters. He added that he believes ""the vast majority of Americans"" would see tax cuts if the plan was implemented. Under the Lee-Rubio plan, the seven current tax brackets would be condensed to just two -- 15 percent for people earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning up to $150,000, and 35 percent for higher-income earners. Corporations would pay a top tax rate of 25 percent, a drop from 35 percent. The plan also would eliminate taxes on capital gains and dividends, create a new $2,500 child tax credit, and eliminate most deductions, except for mortgage interest and charitable giving. Rubio said the plan would serve as his economic and tax blueprint should be announce plans to run for president, as expected, or if he opts instead to run for reelection in 2016. But in his remarks he again declined to signal which race he's leaning toward for 2016. He defended his decision to unveil a comprehensive, specific plan that might open him up to attacks by would-be GOP opponents or Democrats. ""I've tried to govern myself in my entire time in public service by being specific about ideas,"" he said. He reminded reporters about his 100-point reform plan when he was speaker of the Florida House. ""I think people should expect more of their candidates -- no matter what they're running for,"" he added. ""And if in fact we've reached a point in our republic where being detailed about what you would do is a hindrance to winning an election, we're in bad shape, because what are you supposed to then vote on?"" Rubio is expected to formally launch a presidential bid next month and is planning to hold more fundraisers next week as he ramps up his operations, according to aides familiar with his planning. On Monday night, the senator dined in Washington with Sheldon Adelson, the casino executive who spent nearly $100 million helping GOP candidates during the 2012 presidential cycle. Lee, a first-term senator who is also up for reelection in 2016, didn't answer a question about whether his appearance with Rubio signaled he's supporting his Florida colleague for president.

It may seem illogical to direct hopes for agreement toward one of the most far-reaching and politically fraught proposals on the wish list, but, in fact, there are two big forces that can pry open the door to at least a serious bipartisan discussion on corporate tax reform this year.

3500|Suicide Blast at Park Leaves More Than 50 Dead in Lahore, Pakistan|Not even a week after coordinated attacks in Brussels, Belgium, killed 31 civilians, and barely 24 hours after an ISIS attack in Iraq that killed 25, another tragedy: a blast in Lahore, Pakistan, has taken the lives of at least 56 adults and children, with the approximate death toll still rising. A single suicide explosion rocked Gulshan-e-Iqbal park in Lahore on Sunday. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Punjab province health advisor Khawaja Salman Rafique provided a statement estimating that approximately 200 more were injured in the blast, many of them families enjoying a peaceful day at the park in the heart of the city. According to local police chief Haider Ashraf, the bomber detonated near the section of the park containing amusement park rides. Pakistani prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has already expressed his deepest remorse for the victims and those affected, firmly condemning those responsible for the attack. In a statement, the White House decried this cowardly act in what has long been a scenic and placid park, and pledged to continue working with our partners in Pakistan and across the region, as together we will be unyielding in our efforts to root out the scourge of terrorism. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of neighboring India, also condemned the attack. The second-largest city in Pakistan, Lahore has long been considered the cultural capital of the turbulent nation. The placement of this attack, especially considering the environment of family fun and repose that the park afforded, sends a clear message of terror.

3523|U.S. is hitting Islamic State 'harder than ever,' Obama says|"WASHINGTON President Obama said Saturday that U.S. air strikes are hitting the Islamic State ""harder than ever"" amid a stepped-up U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria. taking out more of their fighters and leaders, their weapons, their oil tankers,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address Saturday. ""Our special operations forces are on the ground, because going to hunt down these terrorists wherever they try to hide. In recent weeks, our strikes have taken out the ISIL finance chief, a terrorist leader in Somalia and the ISIL leader in Libya."" Much of the recent effort has been directed at the oil smuggling that is the source of much of the Islamic State's revenue. The National Security Council says coalition airstrikes have destroyed 283 oil trucks, 120 oil storage tanks, and a ""significant amount of oil field infrastructure"" in eastern Syria since Nov. 17. The weekly radio address, which focused on terrorism for the second week in a row, was a more optimistic assessment of the war on terror than any Obama has given since the Islamic State-inspired Dec. 2 shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people. ""Our message to these killers is simple: we will find you, and justice will be done,"" he said. Obama did not directly address the debate over whether to block Muslims from entering the United States, but instead emphasized that most Americans are reaching out to their Muslim neighbors ""to let them know here for each other."" ""Political leaders across the spectrum Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives are standing up, forcefully, for freedom of religion,"" he said. the message I hope every Muslim American hears that all part of the same American family."" In the Republican radio address, Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said Congress was doing its part by voting to tighten the visa waiver program that allows people to travel to the United States from many European countries without advance approval. If we get the right information to the right people, we can keep terrorists on the run and off our shores,"" said Hurd, a former CIA agent. He said the Obama also has to do his part. ""We contain this threat. We have to defeat it. We need a plan and why the House passed a bill that requires the president to come up with a real strategy to defeat ISIS,"" he said. ""We have to be in this for the long haul."|2022-10-03 14:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|Express Tribune|69901|5568|195|9109|Indonesia|English|2022-09-20 03:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1627200|2790000|2335|3.25
3527|San Bernardino divers reportedly pull object from water in evidence search|An FBI dive team reportedly pulled an object from a San Bernardino lake Friday, seeking evidence pinpointing the motive and history of the attackers who killed more than a dozen people during a holiday party. One diver handed the unknown item to an official wearing gloves, who put the object in a plastic bag, the Press-Enterprise reports. Investigators are looking for a hard drive that may have been dumped in the lake, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press. David Bowdich, chief of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said investigative leads indicated the shooters had been in the area the day of the massacre and said the search of the lake could take days. Fox News has learned that in 2012, one of the gunmen, Syed Farook, conspired with former neighbor Enrique Marquez, the man who purchased the rifles used in the deadly attack in San Bernardino on Dec. 2. The plot would have targeted the Los Angeles area. It appeared the two were scared off the idea by the November 2012 arrests of four Southern California men attempting to travel to Afghanistan to wage holy war. The small, urban lake is about 3 miles north of the shooting site. Authorities say Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on his fellow San Bernardino County health inspectors during a holiday party, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. The couple died hours later in a police shootout, leaving behind a 6-month-old daughter. FBI Director James Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar. The FBI has interviewed hundreds of people and conducted searches looking for evidence. Bowdich says it's possible the agency will do neighborhood canvasses in the future, too.

3535|'Massive' French airstrikes hit Islamic State to retaliate for attacks|"France's military launched ""massive"" retaliatory airstrikes against Islamic State sites in Syria on Sunday night, saying French aircraft struck a command center and training camp at Raqqa. The French Air Force posted videos on its Facebook page of the planes embarking on the raid of the extremist group's de facto capital. The strikes come two days after the worst attacks in Paris since World War II. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks at six sites that killed 132 people and wounded hundreds more. The French Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted a command post, a training camp and a weapons depot, dropping 20 bombs on Raqqa. It said 10 fighter jets in the operation came from the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in coordination with U.S. forces. Speaking in Turkey at the G-20 summit, French Foreign Minister Lauren Fabius said, ""France has always said that because she has been threatened and attacked by (Isis) it would be normal that she react in the framework of self defense,"" The Financial Times reported. ""It would be normal to take action. what we did with the strikes on Raqqa, which is their headquarter. We cannot let (Isis) act without reacting. A U.S.-led coalition that includes France has been conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since last year.

""No civilians hit so far, the hospitals are reporting. Electricity and water shut down. Panic among the civilians, the group posted on its website.

3576|Top Iranian nuke negotiator ordered to stop screaming at Kerry|"Iran's foreign minister and lead negotiator in nuclear talks with the United States has been ordered by the Islamic Republic's Supreme Leader to stop shouting and yelling at Secretary of State John Kerry during negotiating sessions. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told his country's state controlled media in a recent interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has instructed him to stop yelling at Kerry and other top U.S. officials during the talks. Reports about Zarif's temper first emerged in the Iranian press last November, when the United States and Iran agreed to extend talks through June of this year. Zarif is said to ""frequently shout at Western diplomats"" with such force that bodyguards have been forced to enter the negotiation room. During one incident described by Iranian officials to the press, European Union Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton, a chief western negotiator, admitted that Zarif had been shouting, and she had gotten used to it. Abbas Araqchi, an Iranian diplomat who is also a member of the negotiating team, is reported to have said in an interview that during past negotiations in Geneva, Zarif ""shouted"" at Kerry and spoke to him in a manner ""unprecedented"" in the history of U.S. diplomacy. Zarif appeared to cop to this behavior during a recent interview with the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), according to an independent translation of the report provided to the Washington Free Beacon.

A local Afghan was also killed in the attack at about 6:40 p.m. on the military side of the airport, said U.S. Army Col. Brian Tribus, a spokesman for the NATO-led Resolute Support mission. An Afghan air force official told Reuters the shooter was an Afghan soldier. Tribus would not confirm whether the dead Afghan was the gunman or a member of the security forces. He provided no information about the victims or their duties. ""This incident is under investigation,"" he said. ""Further information will be released as available and appropriate."" The Taliban subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack. The unnamed Afghan officer described the Americans as ""advisers"" and said ""no one else was there to tell us the reason"" for the attack. In the past several years, more than 142 members of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Taliban insurgents have been killed in so-called green-on-blue insider attacks by Afghan security forces. The shooting was apparently the first of its kind since U.S. and NATO forces ceased their combat mission a month ago. In August, an Afghan solider killed Army Maj. Gen. Harold J.

3585|Ukraine wants UN to label Russia as a sponsor of terrorism|"Ukraine wants the United Nations to brand Russia a terrorism sponsor amid bloody clashes between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government troops. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UN told Fox News he plans to submit a draft resolution asking the UN General Assembly to formally label Russia as a sponsor of terrorism."" Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev gave no timetable for when he would present the resolution to the UN. He said government officials in Kiev are working on the text. Sergeyev told Fox News the resolution will mirror the Ukrainian declaration this week, designating the Moscow-backed separatists in East Ukraine as a terrorist group. Kiev believes that by defining the separatists as terrorists it eliminates any notion that it would engage in peace talks with them. Sergeyev warned of a huge war if the separatists take more territory or build a corridor to southern Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed almost a year ago. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of backing the rebels with troops and weapons, which Russia denies. Meanwhile, artillery fire killed at least 12 civilians in the main rebel stronghold of Donetsk on Friday amid fierce fighting between pro-Russia separatists and government troops as hopes for a break in hostilities were dashed when an attempt to call a new round of peace talks failed. Five people were killed as they were waiting for humanitarian aid outside a community center and two people were killed in the same neighborhood when a mortar shell landed near a bus stop. By the time an Associated Press journalist arrived at the community center, the bodies were taken away. Nearby trees were cut down by what could have been a projectile. Five other people died Friday in sporadic artillery fire in the west of Donetsk. Full-blown fighting between the Russian-backed separatists and government forces erupted anew earlier this month following a period of relative tranquility.

3590|Charlie Hebdo editor-in-chief: ‘Religion should not be a political argument.’|"Gérard Biard, editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, went on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday to discuss the French satirical newspaper's treatment of religion in the aftermath of the attack on its Paris office this month. Across all the Sunday shows this weekend, Charlie Hebdo was what nearly everyone wanted to talk about. Biard said repeatedly that the newspaper does not ""attack religion, but [it does] when it gets involved in politics."" The editor in chief also addressed those newspapers in democratic countries that declined to publish Charlie Hebdo cartoons after the attack. ""When they refuse to publish this cartoon ... they blur out democracy, secularism, freedom of religion, and they insult the citizenship,"" Biard said. Host Chuck Todd also asked Biard to respond to Pope Francis's assertion that one cannot provoke, one cannot insult other faith, one cannot make fun of faith. There is a limit. Every religion has its dignity in freedom of expression there are limits. ""Every time we draw a cartoon of Muhammad, every time we draw a cartoon of the prophets, every time we draw a cartoon of God, we defend the freedom of religion, we declare that God must not be a political or public figure,"" Biard said. ""He must be a private figure."" He went on to say that ""religion should not be a political argument. If faith, if religious arguments step into the political arena, it becomes a totalitarian argument. Secularism protects us against this. Secularism guarantees democracy and assures peace. Secularism allows all believers and all non-believers to live in peace, and that is what we defend."" An editorial that ran in Charlie Hebdo last week mentioned the attention that the newspaper has been getting in unlikely places. ""For a week now, Charlie, an atheist magazine, has accomplished more miracles than all the saints and prophets together,"" the staff noted, later adding,""What made us laugh the most is that the bells of Notre Dame rang in our honor."" Biard was not in Paris at the time of the attack, but he said that those who had survived the attack ""up close"" ""are trying individually to understand why they escaped unharmed.""

3604|Satellite Images Show 'Catastrophic' Destruction Of Boko Haram Attack In Nigeria|"Amnesty International has released stunning satellite imagery that it says ""show devastation of catastrophic proportions"" in Baga and Doron Baga, two towns in northeastern Nigeria that were attacked by Boko Haram. As we've pointed out in the past few days, there has been confusion over just how deadly this attack was. Amnesty International has consistently said that the Islamic militants tore through the towns, burning buildings and killing as many as 2,000 people. The government, however, has denied those claims, saying the death toll is closer to 150. The new images, the human rights group says, show the government estimates are wrong. ""Up until now, the isolation of the Baga combined with the fact that Boko Haram remains in control of the area has meant that it has been very difficult to verify what happened there,"" said Daniel Eyre, Amnesty Nigeria researcher said in a statement. ""Residents have not been able to return to bury the dead, let alone count their number. But through these satellite images combined with graphic testimonies a picture of what is likely to be Boko Haram's deadliest attack ever is becoming clearer."" Here are two relevant photographs from the town of Doron Baga. The first was taken on January 2. The red represents healthy vegetation: The second image was taken January 7: According to Amnesty, those pictures show that more than 3,100 structures were damaged or destroyed by fire, ""affecting most of the 4 square kilometer town.""

3608|Kerry to go to Paris in gesture of sympathy|U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended unity march against terrorism. Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington. The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years. The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments. Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march. Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses. In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as quibbling a little bit. He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India. But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there, he said. And I think the people of France have any doubts about understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.|2022-10-04 11:00:00|REAL|Nora Patel|Daily Beacon|48853|43056|447|8145|Tanzania|English|2022-09-17 21:00:00|Columna|1|True|2865600|1432800|2480|7.45

""I don't see anything in reviewing our work that our agents should have done differently,"" FBI Director James Comey said. But why was the killer allowed to walk into a gun store and buy firearms despite the fact that he had once been under FBI surveillance for nearly a year? Witnesses now say that Mateen was a regular at the Pulse nightclub and dated men. Officials say he also scouted Disney World for a possible attack. Meanwhile, as the investigation continues, the shooting has taken over the presidential campaign. After President Barack Obama refused to even utter the words 'Muslim' or 'Islamic terrorism' in his statement on the Orlando massacre, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expanded his proposed Muslim ban. The billionaire says the doors to the United States should be closed to anyone from nations with a track record of Islamic terrorism, regardless of their religion. ""I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe, or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats,"" he vowed. Trump accused Obama of being willfully ignorant about the issue of Islamic terrorism. ""There's something is going on,"" he said of the president and Islamic terrorism, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at first followed the president's politically correct line. ""Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror,"" she said. But her opponent pounced. Trump said Clinton isn't strong enough on America's enemies. ""Her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world,"" he said. Clinton finally uttered the words ""radical Islamism"" in an phone interview with CNN, but said she would not ""demonize an entire religion."" ""We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves,"" she later admitted. The Democratic response during a raucus session of Congress Monday wasn't on tougher anti-terror laws but gun control legislation. But Republicans stopped it.

Judging by President Barack Obama's response on Sunday, the message may not have reached the Oval Office. ""This is an open investigation. We've reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,"" the president said. ""The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism."" But what kind of terrorism? President Obama did not use the words ""Muslim"" or ""Islamic terrorism,"" even though the killer shouted, ""Allahu Akbar!"" and called 911 to say he was from ISIS. Islamic State radio calls Orlando mass shooter Omar Mateen ""one of the soldiers of the caliphate in America."" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., warns there will be more attacks in part because of the president's reluctance to call the Orlando tragedy what it is. ""And it's not stopping,"" Sessions told Fox News Sunday. ""We see apparently today more of these attacks, and it's a real part of the threat that we face and if we can't address it openly and directly and say there is an extremist element within Islam that is dangerous to the world and has to be confronted, we need to slow down and be careful about those we admit into the country."" FBI Director James Comey says ISIS has created a ""terrorist diaspora"" that flows out of Syria and Iraq to the West, bringing ""hardened fighters, looking to kill people.""

Among the evidence, deputies said they found a list of the names of the targeted victims. Tuolumne County Sheriff Jim Mele said the students confessed. When asked what they said, Mele responded: ""that they were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible."" The sheriff's department said they were contacted on Wednesday by school administrators regarding students who were making threats against faculty and staff. ""As each one of them was identified they were removed from campus,"" Robert Griffith, Summerville Union High School District Superintendent, said. ""Their parents were called."" Deputies said the four students were in the beginning stages of the plot, and no one was hurt. ""I can't imagine getting a phone call that something like that had happened at that school,"" Kristin said. Deputies said the suspects were in the process of obtaining the weapons they were going to use in the attack. All four students were arrested for conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons. Their names will not be released because they're juveniles."|2022-09-03 09:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|City Times|45111|23432|220|5650|China|English|2022-09-02 20:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|133200|180000|1207|3.6666666666666665
3682|3 dead in Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting|"Two civilians and one police officer died after a gunman opened fire at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood, leading to a five-hour standoff with law enforcement. Nine other people, four civilians and five police officers, were taken to local hospitals with gunshot wounds and are in good condition, according to police. The gunman is in police custody after surrendering just before 5 pm local time, police spokesperson Lt. Catherine Buckley told local reporters. The suspect has been identified as Robert Lewis Dear. The University of Colorado police officer who was killed, Garrett Swasey, 44, was described by family and friends as a loving father of two young children and a devoted co-pastor at his local church. The incident began at the Planned Parenthood Colorado Springs Westside Health Center just before noon Mountain Time. The gunman exchanged fire with police officers for hours before he was apprehended, and police worked to evacuate people still inside. Police described the suspect as a stocky, bearded white male wearing a trench coat. He was reportedly armed with a ""long gun."" Reporters have tweeted photographs of the suspect allegedly being taken into custody. The call to the police originated from the address of the Planned Parenthood clinic, although the motives of the shooter are still unclear. ""We're not sure what the connection is to Planned Parenthood, but that was the initial address we were given for the service,"" Buckley said. The FBI warned of threats to reproductive health facilities this past September, in the wake of graphic sting videos that purported to show Planned Parenthood selling fetal body parts for profit. There have been at least four cases of arson perpetrated against Planned Parenthood clinics this year alone. Planned Parenthood released the following statement on the shooting: Colorado Springs is about one hour south of Denver. CBS News is running a live stream of the coverage, which you can watch here."|2022-10-04 12:00:00|REAL|Avery Kim|Daily Beacon|418871|10366|121|6555|Philippines|English|2022-09-09 04:00:00|Opinión del lector|0|True|680400|2869200|1969|2.0166666666666666
3690|Police Use Tear Gas, Arrest 9 During Protests In St. Louis|"Police Use Tear Gas, Arrest 9 During Protests In St. Louis Police used tear gas and arrested nine people during protests in St. Louis on Wednesday. Demonstrators gathered after police shot and killed an 18-year-old they say pointed a gun at them. Police said protesters threw bottles and bricks at them, so they deployed armored vehicles and teams of officers in riot gear. ""The Rev. Renita Lamkin of St. Charles, who regularly attended protests in Ferguson, went to Page Avenue with several other clergy members Wednesday evening. She accused the police of engaging in an overly aggressive response. "" 'There has to be a better way, but the better way is not to terrorize an already terrorized community,' she said. 'How they deal with the situation is classist and dehumanizing. The people here don't matter as much to them.' ""Kayla Reed of the Organization for Black Struggle also said she believed officers were too aggressive toward a crowd 'that never was all that big.' She claimed officers gave no warning firing canisters of smoke and tear gas."" Police defended their actions, saying they warned protesters that the gathering had been deemed an unlawful assembly. As The Associated Press reports, officers were serving a warrant at a home in that neighborhood Wednesday afternoon. They encountered two suspects. ""The suspects were fleeing the home as [18-year-old Mansur] Ball-Bey, who was black, turned and pointed a handgun at the officers, who shot him,"" the AP says. Police say they found four guns and crack cocaine at the home. ""Police said a 33-year-old white officer with seven years on the force and a 29-year-old white officer with nearly seven years experience fired their weapons after Ball-Bey pointed his gun at them. ""A black male in his mid to late teens escaped and remains at large. Police said they recovered a 9-mm gun with 'an extended magazine' from Ball-Bey that had been reported as stolen in Rolla, Mo. They also recovered three other guns at the scene."" Of course, these protests come at a time when tensions in the St. Louis area are running high. The last few weeks have been marked by events commemorating the shooting death of Michael Brown. The protests and clashes with police extended through the night. One vacant house was set on fire and the Post-Dispatch says police have received reports of businesses being set on fire."|2022-09-12 08:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|Sunrise Chronicle|959704|44428|182|1130|China|English|2022-09-03 07:00:00|Opinión del lector|1|True|954000|172800|2367|3.033333333333333

On the screen, he wore a stoic expression as he looked out over the bond hearing. Representatives of the victims were in the courtroom, and got to look into Roof's eyes as they forgave him, one by one. ""I forgive you,"" Nadine Collier, daughter of victim Ethel Lance, said to Roof. ""I will never talk to her ever again, never be able to hold her again. I forgive you and have mercy on your soul. You hurt me, you hurt a lot of people, but I forgive you."" ""Hate win, she said. ""My grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate. plea for your soul is proof that they lived in love and their legacies live in love."" The judge asked Roof whether he understood the charges against him, noting that his next two hearings would take place on Oct. 23 and Feb. 5. Prior to the hearing, a spokesman with the Charleston County Sheriff's Office told The Huffington Post that Roof is on suicide watch and that his family won't be able to visit him for his first 72 hours in jail. But he said that as far as he knew, Roof's family hasn't yet tried to contact the suspect, who is accused of shooting nine people dead at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday. The Charleston Police Department announced Roof's charges, which include possession of a firearm, on Twitter just hours before the hearing. The department confirmed that Roof won't get bond for the murder charges: This is a state that is hurt by the fact that nine people innocently were killed, Haley told the paper, adding that the state absolutely will want him to have the death penalty. Later on Friday, the FBI announced that it will look into the murders as a potential act of ""domestic terrorism"" as part of its investigation. Roof was arrested on Thursday after a florist in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, noticed his vehicle, followed him and called police. He was collared in Shelby, North Carolina, more than 200 miles from Charleston."|2022-09-14 21:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|The Informer|404178|28650|368|4172|South Africa|English|2022-09-01 20:00:00|Editorial|1|True|1173600|46800|2127|6.133333333333334
3719|Does blood on shoe link suspect to Washington slayings?|"(CNN) First, DNA on a pizza crust led authorities to the man they accuse of killing three members of a prominent Washington family and their housekeeper. Now investigators say they have a new clue linking suspect Darron Dellon Dennis Wint to one of the victims: blood found on a shoe he was wearing when authorities arrested him. Forensic analysis matched traces of blood on Wint's shoe to at least one of the murder victims, two law enforcement officials said. The officials would not specify which victim's blood was allegedly found on Wint's shoe. It's too soon to say what role the evidence could play in the case authorities are building against Wint, who has been charged with first-degree murder in the killings last month of Savvas, Amy and Philip Savopoulos and housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa. Investigators said last month they don't believe Wint acted alone . But so far, no one else has been charged in connection to the killings. Police have said they're still investigating, and they haven't detailed exactly what they believe happened in the days leading up to the grisly killings, which came to light when the victims' bodies were discovered after a fire consumed the Savopoulos family's $4.5 million mansion last month. Investigators soon realized the massive fire wasn't the full story. The victims were bound with duct tape, and they suffered from blunt-force trauma, according to a source familiar with the investigation. And there were signs that 10-year-old Philip Savopoulos had been stabbed and tortured, according to the source. The public defender representing Wint has not responded to repeated requests for comment. Attorney Robin Ficker, a lawyer who has represented Wint in the past, has said he believes authorities have ""the wrong guy."" ""I know him to be a kind, gentle, nonaggressive person; (he is) someone you wouldn't mind your grandmother going to lunch with,"" the Maryland lawyer said last month after Wint's arrest. ""... It's a rush to judgment. There's a presumption of innocence, which is not being mentioned by police."" Asked Tuesday about the alleged new evidence tying Wint to one of the victims, he said, ""I have a lot of questions about that. Why is this coming out now?"|2022-09-09 23:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Press Pulse|414682|99282|153|8375|South Korea|English|2022-09-05 10:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|356400|748800|2216|2.55
372|The debate moderators missed the opportunity to ask about a real Democratic divide|"So far, none of the presidential debates Democratic or Republican have asked about K-12 education. That's a huge missed opportunity. Education really is a divisive issue within the Democratic Party, and one on which Hillary Clinton has indicated she might take a different tack than President Obama. Last week, Obama signed a new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act. For the first time in more than two decades, it will scale back the federal government's role in education. While teachers unions and congressional Republicans both like the new law, it's received criticism from the left from those who say that states can't be trusted to safeguard the well-being of poor and minority students. (Clinton said in a statement that she supports the law, although it's not perfect.) This would have been the ideal jumping-off point for a question about education policy: President Obama just signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, which keeps the standardized testing requirement from No Child Left Behind but gives states more freedom to decide which schools are succeeding, and what to do about the ones that aren't. Do you trust states to make the right decisions without federal oversight? And how would you work within the constraints of the law to improve education in the US? K-12 education has been almost entirely absent from the 2016 campaign trail so far. But Clinton's few public statements suggest that she might be friendlier to teachers unions than President Obama, who often antagonized unions with his competitive grant programs, support for charter schools, and push to evaluate teachers based in part on their students' test scores. Clinton, who has been endorsed by both major teachers unions, has suggested charter schools cherry-pick their students. She opposes tying teacher pay to their students' test scores, saying there's ""no evidence"" that approach works. And she's said that getting more funding for traditional federal education programs, such as federal money to educate poor students and students with disabilities, would be a top priority. Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has hardly talked about K-12 eduction at all. And former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was a strong supporter of charter schools while in office. This is a big and important division within the Democratic Party, one that debates repeatedly miss their chance to highlight."|2022-09-20 09:00:00|REAL|Mia Gupta|Capital Gazette|69861|93990|418|9515|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-11 07:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|864000|1648800|2390|6.966666666666667
3743|Feds Search Home in Mohammed Event Shooting|"An Phoenix apartment was searched by federal agents Monday as part of an investigation into a shooting outside a Mohammed cartoon contest. On Sunday, Texas police killed two gunmen after they opened fire on participants in a contest to draw cartoons of Islam's prophet Mohammed in the Dallas suburb of Garland. As the cartoon contest, hosted by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, was ending, two men arrived in a car, jumped out, and started shooting. ""This is very scary. We heard boom, boom, boom, and then all of a sudden we saw the cops everywhere,"" Garland resident Kim Easley told Dallas-Fort Worth's WFAA-TV. ""They drove up, got out, and opened fire on the security officer,"" Garland police spokesman Joe Harn said. After the security guard was hit, Garland police returned fire, killing both gunmen. Sunday's attack took place following remarks by Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker known for his outspoken criticism of Islam. ""We are here in defiance of Islam to stand for our rights and freedom of speech,"" Wilders told contest participants. ""That is our duty."" ""Our message today is very simple,"" he continued. ""We will never allow barbarism, never allow Islam, to rob us of our freedom of speech."" FBI agents are hoping the Phoenix residence will offer clues as to what motivated the shooting. Meanwhile, there's evidence Sunday's attack was inspired by the Islamic State. Approximately 20 minutes before the shooting, a Twitter account expressing support for ISIS used the hashtag #TexasAttack and indicated two men were going to give their lives for Allah. An ISIS spokesman called the gunmen ""brothers"" of the Islamic State."|2022-10-02 21:00:00|REAL|Alexander Lee|The Insight|393595|30164|445|669|Egypt|English|2022-09-21 23:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|1785600|2728800|1642|7.416666666666667

A day of largely peaceful protests was marred by occasional skirmishes between small groups of protesters and police and some destruction of property. As a result, police briefly closed off Camden Yards baseball stadium in Baltimore, where a Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox game was ongoing.

3782|Michael Brown's Family To File Wrongful Death Lawsuit|"The family of Michael Brown will file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, and former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, an attorney for the family announced Thursday. The news comes just one day after the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced its decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for fatally shooting Brown last July. In a press conference, family attorney Anthony Gray expressed the disappointment in the Justice decision and announced the next legal actions they plan to take. We are officially formulating a civil case that we anticipate will be filed very shortly on behalf of the family, Gray said. We plan to demonstrate in a court of law that choice to use deadly force was unreasonable and unnecessary. Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., attended the conference but did not make any comments. However, their frustration with the department's decision is widely shared by many local officials, residents and protesters -- some of whom took to the streets Wednesday evening to demonstrate their outrage. The criticism was further fueled by a scathing report released by the Justice Department, also on Wednesday. The report revealed that the city of Ferguson had engaged in unconstitutional patrolling practices that routinely discriminated against African-Americans. It also disclosed emails proving racial bias on behalf of Ferguson police officials. ""[It] really just confirms what many of us already knew and what has been experienced by many African-Americans here in the St. Louis region for quite some time,"" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told HuffPost Live on Wednesday, referring to the report. ""Some of the specific details were shocking, [but] there's a culture that's been allowed to fester in Ferguson and one that's really been experienced by African-Americans for years and boiled over last year,"" French continued. Attorneys for the Brown family say they hope some level of accountability can be reached through the civil case. Meanwhile, French has taken the lead in calling for the resignation of the chief of the Ferguson Police Department. I think some of the specific details outlined in this Department of Justice report really make it impossible for him to stay there, he said. When you have the culture that exists with these racist emails ... the stats alone suggest he needs to go."|2022-09-22 22:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|Global Gazette|131223|33436|117|7367|Philippines|English|2022-09-21 10:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|1868400|1738800|2392|1.95

3788|Hung jury in Jodi Arias sentencing phase removes possibility of death sentence|"The jury in the Jodi Arias case tasked with deciding whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death for killing her lover nearly seven years ago was unable to agree on terms of sentencing Thursday, removing the possibility of a death sentence. The judge declared a mistrial and will sentence Arias to either life in prison or a life term with the possibility of release after 25 years. It marked the second time a jury has deadlocked on her punishment -- a disappointment for prosecutors who argued for the death penalty during the nearly seven-year legal battle against Arias. Arias was convicted of murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander. The victim's sister, Samantha Alexander, sobbed in court while the decision was announced. The jurors deliberated for 26.5 hours over a five-day span. Earlier this week, Arias' attorneys said jurors were at an impasse, but the judge denied a mistrial request. A verdict does not rule out the possibility of a hung jury. Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply that she nearly decapitated him, and shot him in the forehead. She left his body in his shower at his suburban Phoenix home where friends found him about five days later. She initially denied having anything to do with the killing. She later admitted that she killed Alexander but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after he wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. That jury deadlocked on her punishment, prompting the sentencing retrial that began in October. Chris Hughes, a friend of Alexander, told KPHO that a hung jury would be frustrating. ""My personal opinion is that she earned the death penalty,"" Hughes said. ""I would be OK with life in prison, if she never gets out again, but she deserves the life of a death row inmate."" The day she was convicted of murder, Arias gave a jailhouse interview with a local Fox reporter in which she said she'd rather have the death penalty. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom,"" she said.

3793|Tens of Thousands of Police Expected for Funeral of Slain Officer|"Wenjian Liu, 32, and his partner, Rafael Ramos, 40, were murdered on Dec. 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn after killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley had stated he was seeking vengeance for the deaths this summer of two unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers. Brinsley killed himself after ambushing the officers. With de Blasio expected to speak at Liu's funeral, police commissioner Bill Bratton told officers ahead of Saturday's wake to refrain from the ""act of disrespect"" seen at Ramos' funeral a week ago, when thousands of officers turned their backs on the mayor. ""A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance,"" Bratton wrote in a memo to officers. De Blasio and Bratton entered the funeral home together for the wake as officers stood guard by the entrance, saluting both men as they went in. The murders frayed already strained relations between the police force and de Blasio, who sharply criticized the NYPD's ""stop-and-frisk"" tactics during his 2013 campaign. The liberal mayor also offered qualified support for the wave of protests triggered by the two black men's deaths in New York and Ferguson, Missouri, and has said he talked to his bi-racial son, Dante, about interacting with police. Immediately after Liu and Ramos were shot, Patrick Lynch, the head of the city's largest police union, expressed scorn for de Blasio, saying there was ""blood on many hands."" Ramos' funeral a week ago among the largest in NYPD history, with more than 20,000 officers from around the country on hand. When de Blasio began his eulogy there, many uniformed officers turned their backs in a gesture of disdain, which Bratton called inappropriate, saying it had stolen the ""valor, honor and attention"" that was rightfully due the slain officer. In his memo, Bratton said he understood emotions were running high among the rank and file, adding that his entreaty to the department was not a mandate and he was not threatening to discipline those who did not comply. ""But,"" he said, ""I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor and decency that go with it."|2022-09-25 16:00:00|REAL|Chloe Nguyen|Sunrise Chronicle|264677|37426|347|7879|Vietnam|English|2022-09-09 16:00:00|Reseña|0|True|723600|2106000|2134|5.783333333333333

""I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America's national security,"" Obama said. ""Now what I've also said ... there's a carelessness in terms of managing emails that she has owned and she recognizes. But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective."" The President tried to distinguish between different levels of top secret -- or classified information -- as a means of defending Clinton. ""What I also know, because I handle a lot of classified information, is that there's classified, and then there's classified,"" he said.

381|Democrats are actually more enthusiastic than Republicans about trade|Rank-and-file Democrats and independents are considerably more likely than Republicans to take a rosy view of foreign trade, and have been for several years, according to Gallup polling data. This in tension with the impression you would get from reading articles about the congressional politics of Trade Promotion Authority, where the vast majority of opposition is coming from Democrats, with Republicans singing the virtues of free trade. Part of the issue here is that Gallup is asking, in general, whether foreign trade is more of an opportunity for the US or more of a threat. The congressional debate is about a specific economic agreement, some of whose provisions are only loosely related to trade. Another possible explanation is that trade is currently identified in the public's eye with Barack Obama, who has been heavily promoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But the timing on this doesn't quite work out enthusiasm for trade among self-identified Republicans has been in a long-term decline since the early days of the Bush administration. It's perhaps related in some more generic sense to conservatives' greater nationalism.|2022-09-10 03:00:00|REAL|Noah Khan|The Pulse|911602|8276|262|9330|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-05 19:00:00|Crítica|1|True|763200|388800|1145|4.366666666666666
3816|Obama vetoes GOP attempt to repeal Obamacare|"WASHINGTON President Obama has vetoed the first bill sent to him by Congress this year, a symbolic attempt by Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund abortion provider Planned Parenthood in an election year. ""Republicans in the Congress have attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act over 50 times,"" Obama said in a veto message Friday. ""Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs."" The bill called the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 used an obscure budget-writing procedure known as reconciliation to thwart a Senate filibuster. That maneuver allowed a bill repealing Obamacare to get the president's desk for the first time, forcing him to make good on repeated veto threats. no surprise that someone named Obama vetoed a bill repealing Obamacare,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said, promising a veto override vote ""taking this process all the way to the end under the Constitution."" Republicans are far short of the two-thirds votes necessary for an override, however. It passed the Senate 52 to 47 and the House 240 to 181. But Ryan said the bill proved that Obamacare can be repealed, given a Republican in the White House. The idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for good is a myth,"" he said. ""We have now shown that there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate. So, next year, if sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the bill accomplished nothing. ""It's not significant. It got them nothing, and with the stroke of a pen, the president dispensed with it,"" he said. It was the eighth veto of Obama's presidency, and the White House has issued three more veto threats just this week. In contrast to an elaborate signing ceremony Thursday by House Speaker Paul Ryan, Obama's veto came in a routine veto message."|2022-10-10 00:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|Capital Gazette|870445|61625|319|4299|Philippines|English|2022-10-02 17:00:00|Artículo de investigación|0|True|2714400|3344400|2126|5.316666666666666
3824|President Obama has had an eventful year. His approval rating hasn't budged.|"2015 has been an eventful year for Barack Obama. He made a historic nuclear deal with Iran, two of his Supreme Court appointees voted to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, he's fought with the left to advance his trade agenda, and he gave a speech on race and gun violence that was hailed as the best of his presidency. And none of that has caused his approval rating to budge in the slightest, as you can see in this HuffPost Pollster chart: The full trend of Obama's approval throughout his presidency, which you can see here, has had many more ups and downs. This year's rating of 45 percent approval and 50 percent disapproval is mediocre historically, as you can see over at Gallup (it tops George W. Bush and Harry Truman's seventh-year approval, but is well behind Bill Clinton and Dwight Eisenhower's and slightly behind Ronald Reagan's). Obama's rating is slightly better than it was last year, when it was similarly steady at about 43 percent approval and 52 percent disapproval. But the broader change some expected would result from improving economic news isn't evident yet. Political scientist Alan Abramowitz has argued that unless Obama's approval makes it back up to 50 percent, the Democrat who's running to succeed him should be considered a narrow underdog. He predicted that Obama's current approval rating of 45 percent would likely result in the Democratic nominee getting 49 percent of the two-party vote share, and therefore losing. Now, elections aren't simply a referendum on presidential approval (Abramowitz's own ""time for a change"" model also incorporates GDP growth). And of course, it's possible that future news events could change Obama's approval rating. But all such news events this year have, so far, failed to do so."|2022-09-29 02:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|The Informer|716433|55192|471|3956|Ukraine|English|2022-09-02 01:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|64800|2401200|1760|7.85

3855|Poll: Obama popularity on the upswing|President Barack Obama's popularity with the public is on the upswing, according to a new Gallup poll that found him enjoying his strongest approval rating in nearly two years. That breaks down predictably along party lines, with 90% of Democrats viewing him favorably while only 13% of Republicans say the same. The overall boost in popularity seems to be driven in part by a steady improvement in his standing with independents he's now seen favorably by 52% of independents, up 6 percentage points since April and 17 percentage points since last fall. That's when Obama was suffering from the lowest popularity his tenure, with only 37% of Americans viewing him favorably last fall. But the 53% of Americans that view him favorably don't all approve of his job performance, which typically lags a few points behind a president's personal popularity. Gallup's daily tracking poll found him still underwater with voters in terms of his job performance, with 43% approving while 51% disapprove of the job he's doing in office. Still, that, too marks a favorable upswing from last fall, when Obama was also facing some of the lowest approval ratings of his time in office. Gallup surveyed 1,024 adults from May 6-10 via landline and cell phone, and the poll has a margin of error of 4%.|2022-10-07 14:00:00|REAL|Sophie Chen|The Insight|830399|6113|105|765|Vietnam|English|2022-09-20 08:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|3135600|1645200|1285|1.75

3870|White House Monitoring Iran Aid Ship to Yemen|"An Iranian ship purportedly carrying aid to Yemen should change course and head to Djibouti where the United Nations is overseeing humanitarian deliveries, US officials demanded Tuesday. The US military is tracking the ship after Tehran reportedly said it would send warships to escort the vessel to Yemen, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren told reporters. The ship, the Iran Shahed, had moved through the Strait of Hormuz and was now in the Gulf of Oman, according to the marinetraffic.com site. But the vessel was not under any naval escort at the moment, Warren said. ""We are monitoring the Iranian ship,"" he said. ""We are aware of the Iranians' statement that they plan to escort this ship with warships."" The state Iranian IRNA news agency earlier quoted a naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Azad, saying naval forces would be ""safeguarding"" the vessel. Iran's Red Crescent had said last week that it would send a ship carrying 2,500 tons of humanitarian aid to Yemen, where Tehran-backed Huthi rebels are fighting pro-government forces supported by a Saudi-led coalition. ""The Iranians have stated that this is humanitarian aid,"" Warren said. ""If that is the case, then we certainly encourage the Iranians to deliver that humanitarian aid to the United Nations humanitarian aid distribution hub, which has been established in Djibouti."" ""This will allow the aid to be rapidly and efficiently distributed to those in Yemen who require it,"" he added. When asked if the US military would try to search the ship or prevent it from docking in Yemen, Warren declined to comment. The warnings from Washington raised the possibility of a potential confrontation at sea after tensions flared in recent days in the Strait of Hormuz. The US Navy bolstered its presence in the Gulf after Iran seized a Marshall Islands-flagged vessel in the vital waterway. Iranian authorities later released the ship, citing a commercial dispute with Denmark's Maersk group, which chartered the vessel. ""If the Iranians are planning some sort of stunt in the region, they know as well as we do that it would be unhelpful and in fact could potentially threaten the ceasefire (in Yemen) that has been so painstakingly brought about,"" Warren said. ""We call on the Iranians to do the right thing here and deliver their humanitarian aid in accordance with UN protocols which is through the distribution hub that's been established in Djibouti,"" he added."|2022-09-11 17:00:00|REAL|Mia Gupta|The Insight|934499|42704|102|8888|Pakistan|English|2022-09-04 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|248400|900000|2437|1.7

Apparently, we the people have disappointed him one too many times. Wherever you look, whatever the topic, the spirit of American exceptionalism is sputtering. Our national catechism, that tomorrow definitely will be better than today, is suffering a serious bout of the yips. It has been obvious for some time that the leadership tank is out of gas.

Pfeiffer is one of the president's longest-serving aides, having joined Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign. The White House said he will leave in early March. Dan has been beside me on every step of this incredible journey, starting with those earliest days of the campaign in 2007, "" Obama said in a statement. ""And through it all, been smart, steady, tireless and true to the values we started with. Like everyone else in the White House, benefited from his political savvy and his advocacy for working people. a good man and a good friend, and going to miss having him just down the hall from me."" The New York Times first reported that Pfeiffer will leave the White House. Pfeiffer is one of a very tight circle of Obama aides, often criticized as being too insular, who helped the president win elections and pave the way for passage of the health care law and signing of executive actions on immigration. He was instrumental in helping push forward the White House's social media strategy, becoming one of the first officials to blog and pushing to grow the administration's presence on networking sites such as Instagram and Twitter. An administration official said Pfeiffer has recently been spearheading a review of the White House communications structure. Pfeiffer told Obama that he planned to leave the day after the State of the Union, as the president was flying to Boise, Idaho. A White House official said Pfeiffer has been mulling his next move for some time and feels that the White House is strong, allowing him the space to move on. Pfeiffer is one of a number of trusted Obama aides who have announced their departures in recent weeks - changes that often happen in the second half of a president's second term.

During the long-promised visit this July, Obama will attend a Global Entrepreneurship Summit in the east African nation, a statement said. Obama has visited Africa four times since becoming president, but has not visited the country where he still has relatives. For much of Obama's presidency, Kenya's leaders have been under a cloud of prosecution by the International Criminal Court. Kenyatta was indicted over the country's 2007-08 post-election violence, the worst since it won independence from Britain in 1963. Kenyatta has always protested his innocence. The case was dropped in December, with prosecutors complaining that they had been undermined by a lack of cooperation by the Kenyan government, as well as the bribing or intimidation of witnesses. ""President Obama will meet him in Kenya,"" a White House official told AFP, confirming a meeting that is likely to court controversy. The official, who asked not to be named, said the United States regularly raises ""concerns with the Kenyan government about restrictions on human rights and fundamental freedoms."" ""The president's trip will create another opportunity for dialogue with the government and civil society on these issues."" Obama had visited Kenya before as a senator and before entering politics, visiting his father's home village and taking a very public HIV test. The president's origins have spurred domestic controversy, with some hardline political foes claiming he was not born in the United States and so was ineligible to become president. Obama allies say this is thinly veiled racism. The president has often made light of the controversy. ""If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya,"" he recently joked. On this visit, Obama expected to take part in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), which is being held in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time. ""Hosting the GES is an opportunity for Kenya to showcase its economic progress,"" said the White House official. ""Kenya maintains enormous potential for economic growth, thanks to the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of the Kenyan people."|2022-09-17 20:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|Central Times|148526|95104|414|4866|Sudan|English|2022-09-09 15:00:00|Opinión del lector|0|True|720000|1429200|2294|6.9

Sworn in by Vice President Biden at the White House Tuesday, Carter formally replaces Chuck Hagel, becoming President Obama's fourth defense chief in the past six years. Carter's debut at the Pentagon this morning was briefly interrupted when his wife, Stephanie, ""slipped and fell on the icy pavement,"" the AP reports. ""She laughed it off, and officials indicated she was not injured."" In taking the Pentagon's top job, Carter rounds out a career that has included several stints with the Department of Defense, from leading the acquisitions unit to being deputy defense secretary.

He never served in the military; he was a long-time faculty member of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and he's the author or co-author of 11 books.""

Good economic news appears to be fueling Obama's improved ratings in a string of recent polls.

Biden is in Munich with Secretary of State John Kerry to back the German-French diplomatic effort, which he says is ""very much worth the attempt."" Biden said he and other U.S. leaders think they should attempt an honorable peace"" but that they also believe the Ukrainian people ""have a right to defend themselves."" He suggested that the impact of economic sanctions imposed on Russia for its actions will get worse if leaders refuses to accept a peaceful resolution and continue to escalate the conflict, the White House said Saturday. Russian military forces started taking control of parts of eastern Ukraine in late-February 2014, after protesters and other Ukrainian residents helped oust Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovych. And within weeks, Russian began its ultimately successful effort to annex the eastern Ukraine region of Crimea. In response to recent calls in Washington and Kiev for the U.S. to give the outgunned Ukrainians such lethal weapons as anti-tank and anti-mortar systems to fight Russian-backed separatists, Moscow said earlier this week that such a move would be a threat to its national security. While in Munich, Biden also met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss the diplomatic efforts and to pledge U.S. support for the Ukraine economy as it pursues reforms, according to the White House. Still, Biden remains skeptical about whether Russian officials will comply with a diplomatic solution, saying they will be judged by their actions on the ground, ""not by the paper they sign."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande traveled to Kiev on Thursday and Moscow on Friday. They are trying to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict based on the Sept. 24, 2014, Minsk agreements.

3915|Cuba releases all 53 political prisoners to complete deal, U.S. official says|"Cuba has completed the release of 53 political prisoners that was part of last month's historic deal between the United States and Cuba, the U.S. said Monday The prisoners had been on a list of opposition figures whose release was sought as part of the U.S. agreement last month with the Cuban government. They had been cited by various human rights organizations as being imprisoned by the Cuban government for exercising internationally protected freedoms or for their promotion of political and social reforms in Cuba. The U.S. has verified the release, according to an official traveling with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Islamabad. The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the issue on the record. Among those released were Haydee Gallardo S., a Lady in White, and her husband Angel Figueredo C. who were both arrested in May 2014 on charges of ""public disorder."" The independent rap artist Ángel Yunier Remón Arzuaga, known as ""El Crítico,"" was also released. 'El Critico"" was sentenced to eight years in prison without a trial in March 2013 for ""resistance"" against the communist regime. Last month, Cuba and the U.S. agreed to work to restore normal diplomatic relations as part of a deal in which Cuba freed an imprisoned U.S. aid worker, Alan Gross, along with an imprisoned spy working for the U.S. and the imprisoned dissidents. The U.S. released several Cuba intelligence agents. The deal came after 50 years of hostility between the two countries. There had been much concern in the Cuban-American immigrant community and among aid workers, as well as from top U.S. conservatives like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, who is also a Cuban-American, about the lack of transparency and the secrecy surrounding the identities of the political prisoners. The leader of the Miami-based the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba (FHRC), Francisco Hernandez, was highly vocal about the issue. ""We would like to know the names, because obviously these people are going to need help when they are released, and we want to make sure that they are released,"" Hernandez told Fox News Latino.

3922|Why Hillary Clinton was told not to be a trial lawyer: she didn't have a wife at home|"In 1974, Hillary Clinton learned the biggest challenge for working women: clean socks. In her memoir Living History, Clinton tells the story of the end of the Watergate investigation, after Richard Nixon resigned. Clinton, who was a staff member on the investigation, reveals a conversation she and her fellow attorneys had as they decided what to do once their work ended: Suddenly I was out of work. Our close-knit group of lawyers met for one last dinner together before we scattered to the four winds. Everyone talked excitedly about plans for the future. I was undecided, and when Bert Jenner asked me what I wanted to do, I said I wanted to be a trial lawyer, like him. He told me that would be impossible. ""Because you won't have a wife."" ""What on earth does that mean?"" Bert explained that without a wife at home to take care of all my personal needs, I would never be able to manage the demands of everyday life, like making sure I had clean socks for court. I've since wondered whether Jenner was pulling my leg or making a serious point about how tough the law still could be for women. It's a funny story about antiquated notions about women in the workplace. But it also exposes a kind of shortsighted, classist cluelessness about the problems of working women is doing laundry and other housework really the biggest problem of taking a new job as a woman? Even now, before she has officially announced her plans to run for president in 2016, Clinton already appears to be running as a woman. That's a big change from her 2008 campaign, when she played down her gender: ""I am not running as a woman, I am running because I believe I am the best qualified and experienced person,"" she told Iowa voters in 2007. And with the issues of working women paid leave, the wage gap, and child care, for example a hot topic in the national economic conversation right now, Clinton will likewise have to navigate the class divide within feminism. Those class-related rifts have become more visible in recent years, particularly since the publication of Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In, which was criticized for primarily addressing problems of middle- to upper-class professional women. In case you were wondering, Hillary ultimately never had to face the dirty-socks question; in the end, she chose to follow her husband (or, as she puts it, ""follow her heart"") to Arkansas, where Bill was running for Congress. But the dilemmas will be bigger now as she prepares her run for the presidency."|2022-09-28 20:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Voice of the Nation|189202|35601|225|6858|Myanmar|English|2022-09-02 09:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|93600|2379600|2487|3.75
3930|Phyllis Schlafly: Campus sex assault is on the rise because too many women go to college|In a Monday column for the far-right website World Net Daily, the longtime anti-feminist crusader lamented the declining portion of university enrollments accounted for by men. Schlafly BA and JD, Washington University in St. Louis; MA, Radcliffe College argued that it may even be time to implement quotas to ensure that men constitute at least half of a enrollment. Long ago when I went to college, campuses were about 70 percent male, and until 1970 it was still nearly 60 percent, Schlafly wrote. Today, however, the male percentage has fallen to the low 40s on most campuses. Never one to shirk victim-blaming, Schlafly proceeded to link the problem of campus sexual assault to the increased enrollment of women in postsecondary institutions. Boys are more likely than girls to look at the cost-benefit tradeoff of going to college, Schlafly asserted. The imbalance of far more women than men at colleges has been a factor in the various sex scandals that have made news in the last couple of years. With so many women around, what do you expect a college man to do seek consent!? So, the solution? Schlafly asked. One solution might be to impose the duty on admissions officers to arbitrarily admit only half women and half men. Another solution might be to stop granting college loans, she suggested, thereby forcing students to take jobs to pay for their tuition and eliminate time for parties, perhaps even wiping out time for fraternities and sororities. I went through college while working a full-time manual-labor job, and I regret a minute of it; it was a great learning experience. While minimum wage jobs once sufficed to pay way through college, skyrocketing tuition has created a harsher reality for college students. Absent financial aid and family assistance, the typical college student would now need to work 48 hours a week at a minimum wage job in order to pay for her courses and before accounting for the ever-increasing cost of room and board.|2022-09-25 03:00:00|REAL|Samantha Chen|The Reporter|410310|9579|393|778|Argentina|English|2022-09-06 12:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|450000|2059200|1970|6.55

She is slated to wrap up her term as DNC chair in January 2017 and speculation has swirled around a possible run by the congresswoman. Wasserman Schultz said she has ""gotten tremendous encouragement from constituents"" in her district, Floridians and donors, but ultimately decided against a Senate run. Former Gov. Charlie Crist, another Florida Democrat, also said this week that he would not seek the seat currently held by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is up for reelection in 2016. Rubio is eying a presidential run and has said he would not campaign to keep his Senate seat if he decides to run for president. Wasserman Schultz's announcement opens a wider path for two of her Democratic colleagues in Florida's congressional delegation who are considering a Senate run: Reps. Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson.

Mikulski, 78, is known as the ""Dean"" of the Senate women -- helping forge bipartisan relationships for decades that often result in compromise. Until Democrats lost control of the Senate, she was the chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. ""I had to ask myself this question: Am I campaigning for me, or am I campaigning for my constituents?"" she said Monday. ""Am I raising money or raising hell?"" President Barack Obama praised Mikulski as ""legendary"" and called her ""an institution in the United States Senate"" in a statement Monday that followed her announcement. ""Barbara's service to the people of Maryland spans decades, but her legacy will span generations,"" Obama said. ""Barbara is the longest serving woman in Congress, and her leadership serves as an inspiration to millions of women and girls across the globe to stand up and lead."" Her retirement could present an opening for former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who left office weeks ago and has been considering a 2016 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- though he could struggle to make waves in that race if, as expected, Hillary Clinton runs. It's not clear whether O'Malley would be interested in a legislative seat. But his mother has long served as Mikulski's receptionist in her Washington office.

Voters gave Liberals nearly 40 percent of the overall vote compared to the Conservatives' 32 percent. The left-leaning New Democrats had just over 19 percent of the vote. Justin Trudeau, a 43-year-old former high school teacher and son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, assumes the office his father held from 1968 through 1984 with a short interruption. The youthful Trudeau ran an election that was optimistic in tone, which he said led to his victory. ""We beat fear with hope,"" he said. ""We beat cynicism with hard work. We beat negative divisive politics with a positive vision that brings Canadians together. Most of all we defeated the idea that Canadians should be satisfied with less."" The Associated Press notes the election results could strengthen ties between Canada and the U.S., at least for the remainder of the Obama administration: Conservative Stephen Harper was one of the longest-serving Western leaders.

His father, also a Liberal, often drew comparisons with President John F. Kennedy.

Expressing unease at ""Russia's ongoing support"" for separatists in Ukraine, Obama warned that the failure of upcoming peace talks would lead to more pain for Russia. During the call Obama ""underscored the importance of President Putin seizing the opportunity presented by the ongoing discussions between Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine to reach a peaceful resolution,"" the White House said. ""If Russia continues its aggressive actions in Ukraine, including by sending troops, weapons, and financing to support the separatists, the costs for Russia will rise."" Obama has dangled the prospect of further sanctions against Russia and U.S. arms being sent to the Ukrainian government if talks fail. A four-nation peace summit is planned for Wednesday in Minsk. The United States has voiced skepticism about Putin's sincerity in negotiating. A previous agreement, signed in the Belarusian capital Minsk in September, has been largely ignored by Russia. The White House on Tuesday said that the previous Minsk agreement must be the basis for any new deal. Key points of that deal include withdrawing ""all troops and weapons"" from eastern Ukraine, allowing ""effective international monitoring of the international border"" and freeing hostages, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. ""While we're supportive of continuing diplomatic conversations, what's most important is for both sides to come to the table ready to not just make commitments, but live up to them,"" said Earnest. Obama also spoke to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, offering condolences for the loss of Ukrainian life. A devastating rocket strike on Kiev's military headquarters in the east killed at least 37 people on Tuesday.

Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, is already serving a 20-year jail sentence in jail for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters while president. The then-leader of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was elected president in 2012 after the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian military deposed Morsi in 2013 following a series of street protests against his rule. In May 2014, Morsi's successor, former military chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who led the coup, won a landslide victory in presidential elections. The Muslim Brotherhood was banned and its supporters rounded up by the thousands. As with all capital punishment cases, the sentence will be sent to the Grand Mufti, Egypt's highest authority, for his opinion. Convictions can still be appealed, even if the Grand Mufti approves the sentencing.

For five days, the teenager was covered in the rubble of a seven-story building hit by Saturday's powerful quake. Rescue workers who got him out included an American disaster response team that arrived in Nepal this week. ""The leader of the USAID-sponsored American team was quoted as saying they sent in a camera to find the safest way to extract the teen,"" NPR's Julie McCarthy reports. ""It's what we call an entombment,"" Andrew Olvera, who leads the American team that was involved, tells The Associated Press. ""So, he wasn't specifically crushed. What he was, was inside of a box a box with heavy concrete all around him."" Rescuers had to use jacks to pry away the building's concrete and free the teen, whose age has been variously reported as 18 or 15. The teenager was strapped to a stretcher and was reportedly ""dazed"" but responsive. Olvera said his team worked alongside the Nepali crew. The U.S. team includes emergency workers from Los Angeles County and Fairfax County, Va., CBS News reports. USAID said this week that it sent nearly 130 people to Nepal. Earlier, there had been reports that a second person had been rescued, but those reports have not been confirmed. The good news comes along with reports of fuel shortages, heavy traffic on the roads around Kathmandu and congestion at its airport a situation that aid officials say is hampering the relief effort.

4073|Fidel Castro makes rare public appearance in Cuba|"Fidel Castro, the frail and aging former president of Cuba, made his first public appearance this week in more than a year, shaking hands with a group of Venezuelan visitors, according to official Cuban media. It was also his first public appearance since President Obama announced a new policy toward normalizing relations with Cuba. The 88-year-old Castro was last seen in public in January 2014 at the inauguration of an artist's studio. The official Cuban web site Cubadebate on Friday published four images of Castro sitting inside a bus or van shaking hands with members of the 33-person group of visitors. Wearing a baseball cap and sporting longish gray hair and a beard, Castro is shown gripping the outstretched hand of four different people who lean through the window. Castro's face is largely obscured in the pictures. Cubadebate said the encounter occurred in Havana outside an educational complex on March 30, but did not explain why the news wasn't reported until Saturday. Castro temporarily stepped aside as president in July 2006 due to a serious illness. His brother Raul took over the post permanently in February 2008 after he was elected as the new leader. An article accompanying the photos said Castro shook hands with the Venezuelan group ""for hours"" during the ""chance encounter."" The article said the group noted that ""Fidel is full of vitality."" It said the Venezuelans were impressed by his lengthy and hearty hand-shaking session and the ""lucidity of the attentive listener to the multiple details of the Venezuelan reality, especially now that this great nation has become the target of imperial greed."" In his remarks to the visitors, Castro was quoted as urging people to write to President Obama to stop labeling Venezuela a threat to the the United States. Venezuela, under the late President Hugo Chavez, forged probably the closest ties with Cuba of any country in Latin America. In February and March of this year, official Cuban media published photographs of the former president taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader, with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December, and with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the Associated Press reported."|2022-10-02 01:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Insider Insights|794672|60399|216|4876|Algeria|English|2022-09-14 01:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|2656800|1101600|2218|3.6

In his inaugural address to the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament, Poroshenko promised amnesty ""for those who do not have blood on their hands."" That appeared to apply both to separatist, pro-Russia insurgents in the country's east and to nationalist groups that oppose them. Poroshenko also promised dialogue with citizens in the eastern regions, but excluded the insurgents. ""Talking to gangsters and killers is not our avenue,"" he said, according to a translator. He also called for early regional elections in the east. He assumed power a day after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at D-Day commemoration ceremonies in France. Despite the outreach to Putin, Poroshenko said he will not accept Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""Crimea is, was and will be Ukrainian. There will be no trade-off,"" Poroshenko said. Russia annexed the territory in March after its troops took control of the Black Sea peninsula and Crimea held a secession referendum that Kiev and Western countries regard as illegitimate. Poroshenko, who became a billionaire as a candy tycoon, was elected on May 25, three months after the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in the wake of months of street protests. Putin has denied allegations by Kiev and the West that Russia has fomented the rebellion in the east, and he insisted Friday that Poroshenko needs to speak directly to representatives from the east.

This spending would not just cover electoral, lobbying and other political expenses, but also gifts to universities so they'll teach curriculum adhering to his libertarian economic philosophy and to like-minded nonprofit think tanks influencing and expanding policy debates. Despite all this promised spending, both Charles and David Koch have declined to endorse a candidate in the primary -- which may be why they lack influence. Their refusal to endorse stems from a desire to save resources for the general election and avoid adding fuel to an internecine conflict within the party they most closely identify with. But, as Koch reveals in his comments to the Financial Times, he veers far from Republican orthodoxy on some basic policy questions -- notably, foreign policy. In his own statements, Koch has always adhered to a common libertarian position of non-intervention. He criticized the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq under President George W. Bush, which was backed by congressional majorities in both parties at the time. And now, he is criticizing Republicans for their belligerence towards Muslims and a certain GOP candidate's short-sightedness for proposing to carpet-bomb land held by terrorist groups. We have been doing this for a dozen years, he said. We invaded Afghanistan. We invaded Iraq. Has that made us safer? Has that made the world safer? It seems like more worried about it now than we were then, so we need to examine these strategies.|2022-10-02 05:00:00|REAL|Lily Wang|Times Today|87640|99791|475|9998|Pakistan|English|2022-10-01 12:00:00|Análisis|0|True|2610000|2671200|2170|7.916666666666667
4101|WATCH: On The Missouri Campus, A Clash Of 2 First Amendment Protections|"WATCH: On The Missouri Campus, A Clash Of 2 First Amendment Protections When two rights that this country holds as fundamental come into conflict, it makes for complex drama. That's what happened yesterday on the campus of the University of Missouri in Columbia: Student activists, who had just succeeded in their quest to oust the system president, tried to stop Tim Tai, 20, a student photographer, from documenting what was going on for ESPN. It was a clash between the right to assembly, to be left alone and the right of the press to operate in a public space. The woman seen at the end of the video who appears to grab a reporter's camera has been identified by The New York Times as Melissa Click, an assistant professor of mass media at the University of Missouri. We've reached out to her for comment, and we'll update if she gets back to us. The Los Angeles Times reports that the actions in the video were criticized by the Columbia Missourian, a university newspaper with professional editors and staffed by students from the school's journalism program: "" 'I'm pretty incensed about it,' executive editor Tom Warhover told The Times. 'I find it ironic that particularly faculty members would resort to those kinds of things for no good reason. I understand students who are protesting and want privacy. But they are not allowed to push and assault our photographers our student photographers.' ... ""Tai acknowledged that the demonstrators had a point, since he does recognize there are situations that are sensitive to photograph, but he said that he tries to figure out 'how to cautiously or delicately approach these stories without overwhelming people. "" 'I don't think everyone there is super anti-media, but I think there's misunderstanding about what we do,' Tai said."" Update at 11:35 a.m. ET. A Reporter's Reflection: A reporter for NPR member station KBIA was in middle of what happened yesterday. Bram Sable-Smith put together a very personal reflection about the situation that is worth listening to.

4139|Six cities submit bids to host 2016 Democratic National Convention|"(CNN) - Meet the super six vying for the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The Democratic National Committee on Saturday revealed the six cities - Birmingham, Alabama; Cleveland, Columbus, Ohio; New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix - who submitted bids to host the marquee campaign season event. ""We're thrilled with all the fantastic options that we have going into the next cycle,"" DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a press release. ""We look forward to evaluating these bids and selecting a city to host this special gathering of Democrats."" The press release said a technical advisory committee will evaluate the cities over the coming months, including site visits and ""other inquiries."" The DNC said it will announce its decision later this year or in early 2015. The Republican National Committee is farther along in its winnowing process. Denver, Dallas, Cleveland and Kansas City are the final cities bidding to hold the 2016 GOP convention. The RNC expects to announce its final decision in the fall. In a letter to the DNC, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio pitched Brooklyn as the focal point for the Big Apple's bid to host the 2016 party confab. The progressive mayor, elected just last November, intends to have the sprawling Barclays Center - home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets - anchor the bid and serve as the principal venue site for the convention, with other events and accommodations spread across Brooklyn, Manhattan and New York's other boroughs. The last time New York City hosted a party's presidential nominating convention was the 2004 Republican National Convention. It last hosted a Democratic convention in 1992. Both of those conventions were held in Manhattan's Madison Square Garden. Among the other final five choices for the Democrat's, Philadelphia is the only one to previously host a major party convention. In 2000, Republicans officially nominated George W. Bush as the party's standard bearer at the then-named First Union Center. As first reported by CNN's Mark Preston in April, New York is one of 15 cities that were sent an official request for proposal by the DNC. Those cities were Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus (Ohio), Detroit, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh and Salt Lake City.

4147|U.S. Economy Added 271,000 Jobs In October, Beating Expectations|"In a jobs report that may influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates, the Labor Department says that 271,000 jobs were added in October. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 5 percent, according to the report from the agency's Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's the biggest one-month jobs gain in all of 2015, according to Bloomberg News, which adds that the strong result is one of the positive signs the Fed's economists ""are looking for as they consider a year-end boost in borrowing costs."" Friday's announcement tops economists' consensus expectations, which had forecast a modest gain of about 180,000 jobs. Speaking in Congress this week, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen left open the possibility of an interest rate hike, while also saying it would be ""very gradual."" Citing good economic results, Yellen said there is a ""live possibility"" that policymakers might raise rates when the Fed meets in mid-December. Last month, the Labor Department reported that only 142,000 jobs were created in September, with unemployment holding at 5.1 percent. With today's announcement, the BLS said the job-creation number was being revised to 137,000. October's job growth occurred ""in professional and business services, health care, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and construction,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. As for wages, the month also brought a 9-cent rise in the average hourly earning rate, with workers on private nonfarm payrolls now making an average of $25.20, according to the BLS, which adds that for the group, ""hourly earnings have risen by 2.5 percent over the year."" The agency also says that the number of people who are ""involuntary part-time workers"" due to reduced hours or the difficulty of finding a full-time job ""edged down by 269,000 to 5.8 million in October."|2022-09-24 06:00:00|REAL|Olivia Kumar|Newsflash|914690|65985|141|3390|Turkey|English|2022-09-22 15:00:00|Crónica|0|True|1983600|1843200|1830|2.35
4153|How to Tell Debt Facts From Political Hype|Recent remarks by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, have turned the spotlight back to the U.S.'s $18 trillion federal government debt. The attention follows a period of substantial decline in the budget deficit that countered claims the country was heading rapidly toward debt Armageddon. Here are key facts to remember as you assess what is likely to be a loud and contentious political conversation on debt: Rather than a narrow focus on federal debt, the presidential candidates need to lead a national economic debate on the comprehensive growth strategy that Congress should be implementing. Otherwise, political polarization on Capitol Hill will further undermine the growth performance, erode future potential, and turn debt from mere fodder for political sound bites to a hard-to-solve problem for future generations.|2022-09-20 22:00:00|REAL|Jacob Gupta|Metro News|606070|10110|313|6317|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-07 01:00:00|Análisis|1|True|1695600|496800|854|5.216666666666667

4187|Indiana Gov. Pence backs Cruz for president ahead of state primary|"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Friday backed Ted Cruz for president, days ahead of the vital Republican primary contest. The Republican governor announced his choice in an interview on WIBC radio. He prefaced his announcement by saying he likes and respects and has met with all three of the Republican presidential candidates. not against anybody but I will be voting for Ted Cruz, Pence said. I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda. The announcement is a setback for Trump, who has been barnstorming Indiana with famed Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight by his side trying to rally voters ahead of election and sideline Cruz for good. Cruz is desperately seeking momentum in his fight to block Trump from claiming the delegate majority before the GOP's national convention in July. Trump swept all five Northeastern primary elections earlier in the week and enjoys a massive delegate advantage over his Republican rivals. Cruz has been mathematically eliminated from earning the 1,237 delegate majority, but insists he can block Trump from the majority as well, as the 2016 contest shifts to ""friendlier terrain"" in the West and Midwest. The Texas senator declared he is ""all in"" on Indiana. Cruz said earlier Friday he would ""enthusiastically welcome"" Pence's support. Pence, who faces his own re-election this year, had been under enormous pressure from pro- and anti-Trump factions. Although he is more closely aligned with Cruz, he risks voter backlash in the fall if Tuesday's primary contest shows Indiana is filled with Trump voters. Pence, though, made sure to praise Trump during his remarks Friday. He commended Trump for giving voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with the lack of progress in Washington, D.C.

4190|Trump Scoffs at Cruz Choosing a Running Mate: 'He Can't Win'|"It's an unusual move for a presidential candidate to pick a vice presidential running mate before winning his party's nomination even more unusual when his path to the nomination is blocked. But despite trailing Trump, Cruz went ahead and announced his choice. But will he hit a home run by naming former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate or will he strike out? ""Carly isn't intimated by bullies,"" the Texas senator declared Wednesday. ""Over and over again, Carly has shattered glass ceilings."" ""This is the fight of our time,"" Fiorina said during Wednesday's announcement. ""And I believe Ted Cruz is the man to lead that fight. And I am prepared to stand by his side and give this everything I have, to restore the soul of our party, to defeat Donald Trump, to defeat Hillary Clinton, and to take our country back."" Fiorina tussled with Trump early in the primary season for comments he made about her face. The GOP front-runner dismissed this latest move. ""A new relationship has started Cruz and Carly,"" the tycoon said. ""Cruz can't win. What's he doing picking a vice president?"" Trump had other things to talk about as well. He gave a major foreign policy speech in Washington and said America's allies would have to start paying for their own defense. He also railed on the Bush and Obama administrations for not stopping persecution of Christians in the Middle East. ""We have done nothing to help Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed of that for that lack of action,"" he said. Trump went from there to Indiana where he got the endorsement of legendary Indiana Hooters basketball coach Bobby Knight, ahead of Tuesday's primary. ""If we win Indiana, it's over,"" he said. ""It's over. I'm not playing games with Indiana."" After Indiana votes, Clinton is hoping it's also over for Bernie Sanders. The delegate math is not with Sanders, who rallied thousands of screaming fans at Indiana University hours after he announced the layoffs of hundreds of campaign staffers.

""Things are working pretty well, and I would be worried that if I raised rates significantly with negative interest rates in Europe, I would be very worried about what that would do to the flow of funds."" He also noted that the economy ""is improving month by month."" Buffett spoke at an automotive industry conference in New York, along with the chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway automotive dealer group, Larry Van Tuyl. Buffett and Van Tuyl said that Berkshire Hathaway Automotive is actively looking to purchase more dealerships to add to the 81 auto dealerships it now owns in 10 states. Van Tuyl said that the company will look to expand in the United States and not internationally, at least for now. Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway will price auto dealerships for possible acquisition by using a long-term outlook and not allow short-term swings of the U.S. auto market to affect purchase decisions. He also said those purchase decisions will not be related to changes in interest rates. ""If (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen came up and whispered in my ear what she was going to do for the next two years, it wouldn't make any difference what we do. If we got a chance to buy a dealership at a sensible price with the right people, we'd buy it. We'd buy it in five minutes."" Buffett and Van Tuyl both said that while Tesla Motors Inc. has a model of selling cars directly to consumers, the volume is too low to affect the U.S. auto distribution system. ""Usually when a distribution system becomes that firmly established, there is a reason for it. I just don't see that changing,"" said Buffett. He said that self-driving cars will ""be a reality"" but that he expects autonomous cars to be less than 10 percent of the auto market by 2030. Earlier Tuesday, at the same National Automobile Dealers Association-J.D.

The Fox News exit poll taken among voters in Missouri, Illinois, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, shows that six-in-ten non-Trump GOP voters would consider a third party candidate if the general election matchup was Trump versus Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Four-in-ten Republican primary voters overall would consider a third party or independent candidate, while approximately five-in-ten of late deciders would consider the same choice, Fox exit poll said. Trump himself has repeatedly raised the possibility of running an independent campaign should he be treated unfairly by the Republican Party, despite signing a pledge to support whoever the eventual Republican nominee may be.

Last month, Dole told MSNBC that he might oversleep and not vote next November were Cruz the Republican nominee. Dole also lamented Wednesday that Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor he supports for president, still ""needs to break out,"" and that moderate Republicans seem to have had a tougher time reaching voters this cycle. Should Hillary Clinton take on Cruz in a general election, she'd win easily, he said. So who could stop Cruz from getting the nomination? ""I think it's Trump,"" Dole told the Times.

43|Trump’s campaign just got support from one of the Republican Party’s biggest donors|"Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and billionaire Republican donor, has made up his mind: He's supporting Donald Trump, and other Republicans need to fall in line. Adelson's endorsement, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, matters because he's very wealthy and very willing to spend his wealth to elect Republicans. He spent as much as $150 million trying to defeat President Obama in 2012. His pro-Trump argument boils down to three points: Any Republican is better than a Democrat, Hillary Clinton in particular would be worse, and Trump's CEO experience has to count for something. As Republicans, we know that getting a person in the White House with an ""R"" behind his name is the only way things will get better. That opportunity still exists. We must not cut off our noses to spite our faces. Adelson almost certainly won't be the last prominent Republican to rationalize supporting Trump like this. Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan seem to be working toward a rapprochement. Senate Republicans up for reelection are still dancing around outright endorsing Trump but are refusing to publicly denounce him either. And if anyone had reasons to be skeptical about Trump, it's Adelson, a hard-liner on Israeli security. Trump promised to be ""neutral"" on Israel-Palestine although he later backed away from that stance and to enforce the Iran deal.

The truth is the race has just started, Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, told Fox News Sunday. game on. Fiorina failed to qualify for the prime-time Fox News Channel debate Thursday night for the top-10 ranked GOP candidates. So she competed with the seven others in a forum before the main event. Still, just the exposure was key to her campaign because as a first-time presidential candidate she lacked name recognition, Fiorina said. It was a big night for me, she told Fox. Only 40 percent of Republicans had heard my name. been an uptick in financial support, in support generally. Nevertheless, Fiorina, the only major female candidate in the 2016 Republican field, will have a tough time breaking into the top tier or winning the nomination, considering she has consistently ranked among the last in most major polls. And she is ranked 13th among 15 candidates with 1.3 percent of the vote, according to the most recent averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com Beyond the problem of name recognition, Fiorina will continue to have to defend her tenure at Hewlett-Packard where she laid off 30,000 employees and was eventually fired. On Sunday, Fiorina argued, as she has since the start of the campaign, that she kept the company alive in the post-9/11 and dotcom bubbles. Sometimes, in tough times tough calls are necessary, she said, adding she was fired in a board room brawl. Fiorina said she will continue to do what she has since the start of the race, attack the top candidates, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, and work hard on the campaign trail. She said Trump has ""no excuse"" for attacking Fox new anchor Megyn Kelly for her tough questions to him during the debate. no excuse for this,"" she said. her job to ask tough questions.""

433|A harsh blow to small businesses: Opposing view|Under new overtime rules, employees will be injured as well. The Labor change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees. According to NFIB research, approximately 44% of small businesses would be affected. The department claims that 4.2 million workers could potentially benefit from the change. not consistent with the own analysis. In fact, buried within the regulation, the department projects that many workers receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay. According to Labor, 60% of the newly eligible employees work overtime right now. The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017. The talking points say this is a raise for workers, but the economic analysis says something completely different. Most small businesses have razor-thin margins, and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers. Moreover, the median personal income for small business owners is roughly $68,000 annually, according to NFIB research. Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends, cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country. Those options for most small firms. Employees will be injured as well. Managers who punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet. They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call. Essentially, be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobs. The overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs. NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns. Government regulations consistently rank at the top. Every minute that business owners must devote to keeping records, filling out paperwork and dealing with government inspectors is a minute they have to run their businesses. Every dollar it costs to comply with all of those rules is a dollar they cannot reinvest in new jobs, better equipment or customer service.

4346|Hillary Clinton To Announce Presidential Bid On Sunday|"Updated at 11 a.m. ET Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will officially announce her intention to seek the 2016 Democratic nomination for president on Sunday afternoon, ending years of speculation over her plans to pursue the Oval Office, NPR has learned. People familiar with the campaign plan say that Clinton, long presumed to be the Democratic front-runner even without a formal announcement, will make the announcement possibly via a video and social media, some sources suggest. ""So far, Mrs. Clinton faces scant competition for the Democratic nomination. Polls barely register former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. One potential heavyweight Vice President Joe Biden has said he is considering a campaign but has taken few apparent steps to prepare for one. ""On Thursday, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee surprisingly joined the field, and offered a biting critique from the left of Mrs. Clinton's record on foreign policy. 'The biggest question will be: What exactly did you accomplish in your four years as secretary of state?' he said in an interview. 'There was a lot of dust in the air. Not many concrete accomplishments.' "" Announcing now gives an edge to Clinton, who lost a bitter contest to then-Sen. Barack Obama for her party's nomination in 2008. The head start would give her fundraising team more time to generate the hundreds of millions of dollars typically necessary to mount a successful presidential bid. Following the Sunday announcement, Clinton is ""expected to travel to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa early next week for campaign events. Democratic strategists and advisers spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton has not yet finalized all aspects of her announcement plan,"" The Washington Post writes.

4370|President Obama's persistent and puzzling passivity on terrorism|As soon as the terror in Brussels ended, the post-terror rituals began. Photos and videos of the carnage emerged, victims were given names and faces and allies expressed their sorrow and pledged assistance. Citizens of Brussels, following the lead of New Yorkers after 9/11 and Parisians after two attacks last year, created shrines and odes to the dead. In America, security ramped up as millions feared their cities would be next, and officials vowed to harden our defenses in the fight against State. Unfortunately, the rituals also include President Obama doing something stupid. After each atrocity, Obama acts weirdly detached, a pattern that continued after Brussels. His happy-go-lucky tourist antics in Cuba, followed by tango dancing in Argentina, provided a shocking contrast to fear at home and manhunts in Europe.

4378|Kentucky Clerk's Office Issues Same-Sex Marriage License|"In what was an emotional and contentious scene at the Rowan County, Ky., Courthouse this morning, one dramatic legal standoff came to an end when a gay couple was issued a marriage license. James Yates and William Smith, who had tried this five times before, arrived at the courthouse just as the sun started peeking out from under the mountains on the horizon. They walked past protesters some condemning them and some cheering them and entered the clerk's office. Kim Davis, the county clerk who had stood in their way those five previous attempts, was in jail. She was held in contempt by a federal judge Thursday for refusing to hand out marriage licenses in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court. So early Friday, Yates and Smith walked up to Deputy Clerk Brian Mason. Mason was all business. He checked their licenses, asked them if they were related, took their $35 and, in about five minutes, handed them an envelope and said, ""Congratulations."" Yates and Smith had become the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license from Rowan County. They exited to chants of ""Love has won. Love has won."" ""I don't want her in jail,"" Yates said of Davis. ""No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out. This isn't a blessing. It's an official license."" ""This means, at least for this area, civil rights are civil rights and they're not subject to beliefs."" Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also outside the courthouse with a group of protesters who called this a moral fight. ""We don't hate these people. That's the furthest thing from our hearts,"" he said. ""We don't hate nobody. We just want to have the same rights that they have. They're saying, 'Hey we're gonna make you accept us.' But they don't want to accept our beliefs. But they want us to accept theirs.""

The Florida senator also added said that same-sex marriage was not a constitutional right and should be decided by state legislatures, not the courts. Despite his position, Rubio added that he didn't think being gay was a choice. ""I also don't believe that your sexual preferences are a choice for the vast and enormous majority of people,"" he said. ""In fact, the bottom line is I believe sexual preference is something that people are born with."" Last week, Rubio also said that he would attend a gay wedding of a loved one, even if he disagreed with the ""choice"" that loved one had made. not going to hurt them simply because I disagree with a choice made or because I disagree with a decision made, or whatever it may be, Rubio said. Ultimately, if someone that you care for and is part of your family has decided to move in one direction or another or feels that way because of who they love, you respect that because you love them. In the past, Rubio has distinguished between opposing same-sex marriage and being anti-gay. ""Supporting the definition of marriage as one man and one woman is not anti-gay.

4423|Megyn Kelly interrogates Tom Cotton on Iran letter: “What’s the point in writing to the Iranian mullahs?”|On Monday, Cotton drafted a letter signed by 46 other senators addressed to leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, warning that any deal reached on the nuclear program could be killed by the next administration with the stroke of a pen. The letter generated fierce criticism not only from the Obama administration and congressional Democrats, but also from conservative quarters, including the Wall Street editorial board, which Kelly noted called correspondence a distraction. Well, on the contrary, Megyn, I think that this debate having is incredibly important and helpful to raising just what a bad deal President Obama is about to make with Iran, Cotton responded. The last two days, focused on the terms of the deal, which is: One, President Obama will accept a 10-year sunset clause; and two, he has conceded a vast uranium enrichment capability to Iran that paves the way for Iran to get the bomb, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said last week, he added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin inflammatory March 3 address before Congress. Kelly pressed: But the point in writing to the Iranian mullahs? What are you gonna do? She noted that many in the Iranian leadership have dismissed letter, while he has irked the Obama administration and even alienated congressional Democrats skeptical of the nuclear talks. Megyn, if you talk to most Iran experts, tell you that leaders understand our constitutional system, Cotton answered. So we need to be crystal clear with the leaders of Iran: Any deal not approved by Congress be accepted by Congress, he later said. Kelly continued to emphasize that if Cotton is so keen on congressional review, offending Democrats in Congress may not be the optimal way to go about the matter.

A fact sheet on the framework accord issued by the U.S. State Department said Iran would be required to grant the U.N. nuclear agency access to any ""suspicious sites.""

The findings sharply contradict previous statements by President Obama and other White House officials that the Islamic State has been ""contained"" by a program of U.S.-led airstrikes and the deployment of approximately 3,500 U.S. forces to train and otherwise aid moderate Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters. On Sunday, a U.S. official told Fox News that ISIS has been able to effectively recruit and attract affiliates despite losses on the ground, and has now supplanted Al Qaeda as the primary global jihadist threat.The official said that going forward, the entirety of the ISIS threat must be addressed, and the group's main base of operations in Syria must be degraded. The findings were first reported by The Daily Beast, which said the White House asked for the assessment prior to the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, in which ISIS militants killed 130 people in a series of coordinated shootings and suicide bombings. In response to the report, The Daily Beast said President Obama had directed Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford to come up with new strategies against ISIS. One recommendation, announced by Carter Tuesday, is a special operations cell with the ability to capture senior ISIS leaders in the hope of finding out more about their networks. However, the Daily Beast reported that Carter's announcement took military planners by surprise, since they had yet to finalize important details, including the rules of engagement under which such raids would be carried out.

The number of weapons dismantled was 109, the lowest figure since at least 1980. In 1945, the size of the stockpile matched the number of weapons deployed -- two. The biggest reductions came in the early 1990s during the administration of George H.W. Bush and, a decade later, during his son's. At the end of 2008, the stockpile numbered 5,273; over the course of Obama's two terms, it has dropped to 4,571. It is, of course, easier to reduce the size of a stockpile when it is much larger. As a fraction of the total weapon count, Obama has sliced the total by a bit more than one-tenth -- 13 percent. But the Federation of American Scientists is still critical of Obama's progress in this regard. That 13 percent is ""the smallest reduction of the stockpile achieved by any previous post-Cold War administration;"" the 109 dismantlings last year continues ""a trendline of fewer and fewer warheads dismantled"" under Obama. The FAS notes that there are reasons outside of the administration's control for the lower number last year -- but also that political pressure discourages a push for reduction. Why does the size of our stockpile matter? As data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows, the United States still controls about half of the weapons controlled by recognized nuclear states."|2022-09-27 08:00:00|REAL|Jacob Gupta|The Informer|388693|84242|568|9700|South Africa|English|2022-09-24 10:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|2250000|1998000|2081|9.466666666666667
4459|Obama on 'The Daily Show:' What happened to common conversation? (+video)|President Obama talks political polarization and the 'Balkanization' of the media in his seventh and final appearance on 'The Daily Show' on Tuesday night. President Obama made his seventh and final appearance on The Daily Show Tuesday night to reflect on his time spent in office and the lessons learned. The one thing I know as I enter my last year as president is the country is full of good and decent people and there is a sense of common purpose at the neighborhood level and at the school and in the workplace, Mr. Obama told host Jon Stewart. And that dissipates the further up it goes because of the money and all the filters and all the polarizing that takes place in how politics are shaped, he continued. Part of this polarization, Obama said, is due to the changing nature of the media. I think [the media] gets distracted by shiny objects and always focus on the big, tough choices and decisions that have to be made. And part of that is just the changing nature of technology, he said. The president admitted that the White House was way too slow in trying to redesign and reengineer the structure of its Press Office to adapt to online and social media, and lamented the Balkanization of the media in recent years. got folks who are constantly looking for facts that reinforce their existing point of view as opposed to having a common conversation, Obama said. I think one of the things that we have to think about, not just the president but all of us, is how do we join together in a common conversation about something other than the Super Bowl. The only way everyday citizens can prevent this polarization, the president continued, is by getting involved and contacting local representatives. He went on to guarantee that if people feel strongly about making sure Iran get a nuclear weapon without us going to war and that is expressed to Congress, then people will believe in that. Other topics discussed in the 22-minute interview were the Iran deal, which Obama portrayed as the best achievable compromise, and progress made in the fields of healthcare and climate change. He also cited improvements in the Department of Veteran Affairs, the economy, and the efficiency of government in general. What I do think has happened is a lot of the work that we did early starts bearing fruit later, Obama said, giving the example of the Iran negotiations. So it finally comes to fruition. But it represents a lot of work.|2022-10-01 01:00:00|REAL|Alexander Lee|The Insight|403584|84791|293|4006|Kenya|English|2022-09-10 13:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|799200|2570400|2438|4.883333333333334
4477|A GOP Weekend, Courtesy Of The Koch Network And Citizens United|"A GOP Weekend, Courtesy Of The Koch Network And Citizens United Republican presidential hopefuls are turning out this weekend for two big events, but just one of them, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, plans to be at both. Cruz is among seven possible contenders who spoke Saturday at the Iowa Freedom Summit, co-sponsored by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and the group Citizens United. Sunday night, Cruz is scheduled to join two possible primary rivals, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., at a semi-annual conference of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. Freedom Partners is a central part of the powerful conservative network assembled by billionaires David and Charles Koch. Cruz, Rubio and Paul are to appear Sunday in a ""national policy forum"" moderated by ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl. The discussion is to be live-streamed to news organizations, although not to the general public. The conference runs through the weekend, providing well-heeled donors in the Koch network a chance to get acquainted with likely candidates. The live-streaming marks a break with barring reporters from covering the conferences. But in recent years, the conferences have been beset by leaked documents and surreptitious audio recordings. Last June, someone recorded Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, then running for re-election, saying the day the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law was signed was ""the worst day of my life."" Another audio clip, in which Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst praised the Koch network, was used in an attack ad in her Senate bid, which she won. There are indications that the Koch network may engage in the GOP presidential primary a step it's previously avoided taking. As a measure of the network's clout, the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising, estimates that in the 2014 midterm elections, four Koch groups ran more than 12,000 TV ads, at a cost exceeding $25 million. The groups were the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the superPAC Freedom Partners Action Fund and the social welfare groups Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans for America."|2022-09-28 06:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|The Informer|724282|43726|148|102|DR Congo|English|2022-09-07 02:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|2329200|500400|2123|2.466666666666667
4478|Newt Gingrich: If Hillary Clinton Runs In 2016, Republicans 'Incapable Of Competing'|Clinton certainly has the resume to be a strong presidential contender: two terms as the first lady during her husband's popular administration, eight years as a U.S. senator from New York and four as a widely-acclaimed secretary of state under President Barack Obama. Not to mention that she has already mounted a presidential bid once before, during the 2008 Democratic primary. With quite a following among Democrats -- particularly women -- and an expert campaigner as a husband, Clinton is one of the frontrunners for the 2016 nomination. In fact, if the Iowa caucuses were held today, a Public Policy Polling survey found she would win 58 percent of the vote, outstripping the runner-up, Vice President Joe Biden, by a margin of 41 percent. Now the question is whether or not Clinton will decide to throw her hat in the ring in 2016. After her term as secretary of state ends this year, she has declared her intention to take a year off from politics entirely. And after that? Clinton says that she does not want to run in 2016, but that hasn't quashed hopes to the contrary. -- Sarah Bufkin|2022-10-09 02:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|Global Insight|923557|34500|329|82|Ukraine|English|2022-09-09 01:00:00|Columna de humor|1|True|669600|3265200|1097|5.483333333333333
4491|U.S. Flag Flies Over Embassy In Cuba For First Time In 54 Years|"U.S. Flag Flies Over Embassy In Cuba For First Time In 54 Years Updated at 11:25 a.m. ET Secretary of State John Kerry presided over a ceremony reopening the U.S. Embassy in Havana, including a flag-raising ceremony an event that will mark the first time the Stars and Stripes have flown over a diplomatic compound there in 54 years. Kerry, speaking before assembled dignitaries, remembered the strained history of U.S.-Cuba relations, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Soviet Union was discovered to be siting nuclear rockets on the island nation. ""I was a student then and I could still remember the taut faces of our leaders,"" he said. ""We were unsettled and uncertain about our future because we didn't know when we went to bed what we would find when we woke up."" The people of Cuba ""would be best served by a genuine democracy,"" he said, but added that it was ""unrealistic"" to expect Cuba to make such a transition anytime soon. ""Cuba's future is for Cubans to shape,"" he said. Speaking in Spanish, Kerry said the ceremony showed that the U.S. and Cuba ""are no longer enemies, but neighbors."" Three U.S. Marines who lowered the flag at the embassy in 1961, when Havana and Washington severed diplomatic ties, accompanied Kerry to the ceremony and presented the new flag to Marines to hoist once again to the strains of the Star Spangled Banner. The Washington Post reports that the three Marines, retired Master Gunnery Sgt. Jim Tracy and then-Lance Cpl. Larry C. Morris and then-Cpl. F.W. Mike East, all now in their 70s, ""will appear in Havana alongside Secretary of State John F. Kerry and raise the flag again. It has been more than 54 years since U.S. relations with Cuba were severed, but the embassy has reopened following an agreement reached earlier this year between Havana and Washington."" NPR's Michele Kelemen says: ""The State Department has come under criticism for not inviting leading Cuban dissidents to the embassy. Officials say that's because this is a government-to-government event. Activists are invited to a reception later, at the U.S. ambassador's residence.""

4499|Obama Looking For Justice Who Will 'Interpret' The Law, Not 'Make' It|"Obama Looking For Justice Who Will 'Interpret' The Law, Not 'Make' It The legal world has a new blogger: former constitutional law professor and current President Barack Obama. The president took to SCOTUSblog, the leading online chronicle of the Supreme Court, on Wednesday to offer some ""spoiler-free insights"" into what he is seeking in a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Aside from ""mastery of the law,"" Obama said he wants to choose a nominee who understands ""a judge's job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" But in cases where the law's unclear, the president wrote, he will look for ""the kind of life experience learned outside the classroom and the courtroom; experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people's lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times."" And, about those times: Senate Republicans signaled this week they will take no action on whomever the White House nominates. All 11 GOP members of the Judiciary Committee signed a letter Tuesday saying they would not give their consent under the Constitution. The lawmakers said they did not intend to even meet with the nominee, let alone hold a public hearing on his or her qualifications. On Wednesday, President Obama blasted the politics of the Senate, and said the American people would have the chance to judge his nominee something of a public relations campaign. ""My hope an expectation is that once there is an actual nominee... that those on the judiciary committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them. They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates."" ""I'm going to do my job, I'm going to nominate someone,"" he continued, ""and let the American people decide as to whether that person is qualified."" That means the court could operate without a full complement of nine members for a year or more, the equivalent of two terms of the Supreme Court. At least one current justice, Samuel Alito, commented on that, telling an audience at Georgetown Law school this week, ""We will deal with it."" ""There's nothing in the Constitution that specifies the size of the Supreme Court,"" Alito said. ""There were times in the history of the court when the court had an even number of justices. They must have been more agreeable in those days."|2022-10-11 07:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Global Gazette|442368|64241|350|9392|Algeria|English|2022-09-27 16:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|3456000|2278800|2431|5.833333333333333

""And my answer is when there are nine,"" she said, as if the question even needed to be asked. Ginsburg also spoke about the difficulties she faced attaining a job in the legal field. ""In those days, in the Southern District, most judges hire women. In the U.S. office, women were strictly forbidden in the Criminal Division. There was one woman in the Civil Division,"" she said. ""And the excuse for not hiring women in the Criminal Division was they have to deal with all these tough types, and women up to that. And I was amazed,"" she added. ""I said, have you seen the lawyers at legal aid who are representing these tough types? all women."" In what is sure to further her ""Notorious RBG"" status, the justice later also delivered this gem of a quote: ""If I had any talent in the world, any talent that God could give me, I would be a great diva."|2022-09-21 10:00:00|REAL|Victoria Singh|Morning Star|381283|3174|384|6213|Turkey|English|2022-09-11 23:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|921600|1738800|1092|6.4

If you looked closely crime scene photographs - you can see the sign -- plastered on the front of a bullet- riddled window. Click here to follow Todd on Facebook for conservative conversation. Four Marines were slaughtered -- a fifth wounded -- along with a Chattanooga police officer. Authorities say the gunman, identified as 24-year-old Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed in a shoot-out. Abdulazeez is reportedly a Kuwaiti-native who attended high school in the Chattanooga area. The Times Free-Press posted his graduation photo that included the phrase; My name causes national security alerts. What does yours do? The FBI says too soon to speculate on the motive but I think all got a pretty clear understanding of what went down. As many as 50 shots were fired -- and all the survivors could do was barricade themselves inside. The brave men and women who staff these military recruiting stations are sitting ducks. Soft targets - is the terminology they use. The same thing happened at the Fort Hood massacre. In response to the shooting Homeland Security ordered enhanced security measures at federal buildings. Since they carry weapons what are they going to do? How are they going to defend themselves against the next Muhammad Abdulazeez -- lock the doors, pull the shades? It's time to arm the Armed Forces. Now, sure the experts will say some sort of logical reason why military personnel should not have access to firearms but not convinced. Brave Marines gunned down in a Southern city -- and that is something we cannot abide. Our elected leaders must give them at least a fighting chance.

The number of new jobs was higher than many economists had anticipated; NPR's John Ydstie says experts had expected about 200,000 new jobs. In November, the BLS initially said the economy added 211,000 jobs a ""healthy pace,"" as NPR's Marilyn Geewax put it. That number has now been revised upward, to 252,000. The job gains for October have also been revised up, from 298,000 to 307,000. With the revised numbers, the past three months have seen an average of 284,000 new jobs each month. The unemployment rate has held at 5 percent all three months. Professional and business services, the restaurant industry, health care and construction showed some of the strongest job growth in December, the Bureau says, while mining jobs declined and manufacturing jobs stayed stagnant. The labor participation rate was little changed in December, and average wages fell by a penny. Over the year as a whole, average wages rose 2.5 percent, the BLS says the fastest rise since 2008. But a healthy growth rate for wages would be ""in the 3-4 percent range,"" writes The Wall Street Journal. All told, employers created 2.65 million new jobs last year not as strong as 2014's 3.2 million total jobs, but enough to make 2015 the second-best year for U.S. job growth since 1999, The Associated Press reports.

But Royal Dutch Shell's decision last month to suspend its oil exploration in offshore Alaskan waters citing disappointing results from a well in the Chukchi Sea prompted the Interior Department to cancel further oil leases. In light of announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half, said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. The Obama administration came under fire from environmental groups after approving permits for Shell to drill even as President Obama was embarking on a three-day trip to Alaska to highlight the effects of climate change in the Arctic. Those same groups applauded Friday's move, with the Natural Resources Defense Council calling it ""an essential reprieve"" for Arctic Waters. ""The next step should be to take Arctic and Atlantic waters off the table to oil and gas drilling for good,"" said NRDC's Franz Matzner. Also Friday, the department also denied requests by Shell and the Norwegian company Statoil to extend existing years beyond 10 years. Both companies had asked for five-year extensions, arguing that they should have more time because regulations had prevented them from exploring for oil. Without those extensions, the leases will expire by 2020. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the decision was ""absurd."" The Interior Department is throwing up regulatory roadblocks to prevent drilling, she said and then using the lack of drilling to justify canceling the lease sales. This is a stunning, short-sighted move that betrays the Interior commitments to Alaska and the best interests of our long-term energy security,"" said Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee. decision is the latest in a destructive pattern of hostility toward energy production in our state that began the first day this administration took office, and continued ever since."|2022-09-19 14:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|National Courier|590644|81604|255|5034|Mexico|English|2022-09-11 02:00:00|Artículo de investigación|1|True|1580400|846000|2166|4.25

On Tuesday, he affirmed that long-range flights are rising and occurring in places they before, like near Canada, Alaska and the English Channel. He also confirmed there are two Russian Navy ships off the shores of the United States, reportedly near Cuba and Venezuela. The comments are the latest sign of military and other tensions rising between the U.S. and Russia, which is accused of stoking the fighting in eastern Ukraine despite international sanctions and condemnation. Gortney described intervention in Ukraine as part of a new doctrine, which employing. The Russians have developed a far more capable military than the quantitative, very large military that the Soviet Union had, he said. In sheer numbers, the Soviet military was still much bigger than today. According to statistics published in The Washington Post, the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s had more than 5 million in its armed forces, and even more in its reserves. Today, its armed forces number fewer than 1 million, with its reserves at 2 million roughly comparable to the total forces of the U.S., but smaller than the total NATO force. We watch very carefully what they're doing, Gortney said, while noting that Russian aircraft are adhering to international standards that are required by all airplanes that are out there. CNN also reported Tuesday that Russian hackers were able to breach a White House computer system after a successful cyber-attack on the State Department. The White House has not publicly confirmed this.

4590|Trump Gives Victory Speech, Liberals Rediscover Appeal of Limited Government|"President-Elect Donald Trump preached national unity and vowed to ""reclaim our country's destiny,"" in his victory speech, which was delivered around 3:00 a.m. in New York City. Rival candidate Hillary Clinton had already called Trump to concede, he told the crowd. ""She fought very hard,"" he said. ""Hillary has worked very long and hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely."" Trump then turned to the business of healing the vast political divide. He promised to be a president for all Americans. ""For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country,"" he said. The president-elect claimed to have a ""great"" economic plan, though he offered no details. He closed by thanking his most vocal family, Rudy Giuliani, Sen. Jeff Sessions, Ben Carson, and assuring the American people that ""you'll be so proud of your president"" by the time his reign comes to an end. Trump's election has sent shockwaves: the markets are in free-fall, Democratic voters are petrified, and the media has no idea what just happened. Libertarians should be girding themselves for four years of the federal government trampling their of course, we've come to expect that regardless. As I wrote on Facebook earlier tonight, it's perhaps moments like this where the case for the libertarian vision of a constrained government is most powerful: I'm watching MSNBC as I write this, and I just heard Lawrence O'Donnell say the following: That didn't take long: the left is interested in limited government again.

4597|Justice Department Staffers Monitor Polls on Election Day|"More than 500 staffers from the Justice Department will be monitoring polling stations across 28 states Tuesday. Those staffers have been dispatched to 67 jurisdictions and will be watching for civil rights violations, including racial discrimination. ""As always, our personnel will perform these duties impartially with one goal in mind: to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday. The announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation. ""Observation at the polls should not cross the line into intimidation, that's key,"" The Christian Science Monitor quoted Ned Foley, a constitutional law professor at Ohio State University's Moritz School of Law. On the other hand, there have also been concerns about voter fraud, with some 41 percent of Americans believing the election could be stolen, according to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll. Speaking at a restaurant and bar in Anderson Township, Ohio, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin defended recent claims by Donald Trump that the election could be rigged. ""Of course he gets crucified by the press saying he's conspiratorial or something, saying there could be voter fraud,"" she said. ""Well, primaries can be fixed, and debate questions can be fixed, and dead people can vote."" In 2012, about 780 monitors were dispatched. This year, that number is down by about 35 percent. Justice Department officials say they hope voters will not detect any difference in the federal presence. ""In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers,"" Vanita Gupta, head of the agency's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement Monday. ""We work closely and cooperatively with jurisdictions around the country to ensure that trained personnel are able to keep an eye on the proceedings from an immediate vantage point."" she said."|2022-09-27 20:00:00|REAL|Lucas Kim|Daily Beacon|123610|32014|237|430|Nigeria|English|2022-09-27 09:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|2253600|2293200|1957|3.95

461|US economy added 223,000 jobs in April|Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and non-game-changing to happen. Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom. Dive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly. There's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track. Wage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce. Overall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker. Perhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007: The population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.|2022-09-27 23:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Sunrise Chronicle|14513|31344|352|6604|South Africa|English|2022-09-17 06:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|2304000|1378800|2145|5.866666666666666

4638|'There's No Case Here.' Clinton Defiant amid Email Probe|"The race for the White House has become even more uncertain as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. The emails were found on a laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl. Officials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day. Meanwhile, the presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days. The gap was closing even before Friday's news that the FBI would reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails, but now the contest is virtually a dead heat. Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College. Consequently, both candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided. Addressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy. ""I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go? That's a good question,"" Clinton said. ""First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses, I understand and I regret it,"" she continued. ""They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here."" Meanwhile, campaigning in Michigan, Republican rival Donald Trump kept his focus on Clinton's latest controversy. ""Thank you, Anthony. I never liked you, Anthony, but thank you very much,"" the GOP nominee said. ""The Clinton crime spree ends on Nov. 8. It's gonna end on Nov. 8."" Clinton could face more problems in the days ahead. WikiLeaks is reportedly set to release more hacked emails related to the presidential campaign. The organization has already caused another problem for Democratic operatives. CNN dropped former analyst Donna Brazile after WikiLeaks revealed she had leaked a question from one of the debates in the Democratic primary to the Clinton campaign. No one knows what effect the FBI investigation or the WikiLeaks releases will have before Election Day. The last week before the election could be as unpredictable as the entire campaign has been so far this year."|2022-09-29 01:00:00|REAL|Sophie Chen|Newsline|141307|26328|414|7757|Kenya|English|2022-09-01 17:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|36000|2397600|2497|6.9
4643|Clinton Camp Tries to Deflect Suspicion as FBI Reopens Email Case|"After the bombshell announcement Friday that the FBI is reopening the Clinton email investigation, Hillary Clinton looked awkward on the campaign trail as she tried to take suspicion off herself and put it on FBI Director James Comey. ""Some of you may have heard about a letter,"" Clinton said to a chorus of boos from her supporters. ""It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it is deeply troubling."" The Wall Street Journal reported that Comey's letter sent to lawmakers Friday said that 650,000 emails were discovered on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Wiener, the estranged husband of Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. Weiner is under criminal investigation for allegedly sexting a teen. Metadata on the emails suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from then-Secretary of State Clinton's private server. Comey said the FBI would take steps to review those emails to see if any were classified. A law enforcement official says the intelligence agency has obtained a search warrant. ""We commend the FBI for reopening this case and having the courage to stand up for the principle because no one is above the law in the United States of America,"" Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence told supporters in North Carolina. But Clinton campaign chair John Podesta attacked Comey, telling CNN, ""To throw this in the middle of the campaign 11 days out just seemed to break with precedent and be inappropriate at this stage."" Both campaigns want the FBI to release what it knows, but since it's an ongoing investigation, that's probably not likely. According to multiple reports, many agents in the FBI were unhappy with Comey's original handling of the Clinton email investigation and his decision not to recommend charges against her. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called it the biggest scandal since Watergate: ""We never thought we were going to say 'thank you' to Anthony Weiner,"" he said. The reopened FBI investigation is sure to impact a race that has already tightened, with the latest polls showing Trump has made it a virtual dead heat."|2022-09-21 00:00:00|REAL|Gabriel Santos|City Times|726343|44291|698|7937|Egypt|English|2022-09-20 17:00:00|Columna de humor|0|True|1702800|1677600|2232|11.633333333333333
4647|Road to 270: 's new election map|"Washington One week after we moved Nevada and Florida from ""battleground"" to ""lean Democratic,"" both states appear to be snapping back to their traditional toss-up status. Our new CNN electoral outlook places both states back in the ""battleground"" category and increases the up-for-grabs turf to six states and two congressional districts worth a total of 87 electoral votes. Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. Clinton had not yet finished her two-day swing through the Sunshine State before her campaign let it be known that she would be back in Florida this weekend. Florida is also one of the handful of states where the Clinton campaign remains heavily on the air with campaign advertising and where it announced today that two closing argument ads will begin to be seen across the state. Florida's 29 electoral votes are the biggest prize on the map among competitive states and both campaigns plan to fight it out there all the way through November 8. In Nevada, polls continue to show it is a margin-of-error race between Clinton and Trump and both candidates are expected back in the Silver State before Election Day. As Trump continues to shore up his Republican support and improve his standing among Hispanics (though still losing this group by a wide margin), he is ensuring Nevada remains competitive all the way through Election Day. With the new changes to the CNN electoral outlook, our current snapshot has Clinton at 272 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in her direction. Trump has a total of 179 electoral votes from the states either solidly or leaning in his direction. That leaves 87 electoral votes currently up for grabs in the remaining battleground states.

Abedin recently announced the separation after Weiner became embroiled in a new series of embarrassing online sexting scandals, including one allegedly involving an underage girl that prompted the FBI to investigate. One month earlier, Trump said he like the thought of Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.

And she's seen as the incumbent."" ""He delivers his own speeches. This is his candidacy. He's the guy who's running for the White House, and he has the privilege to say what he wants,"" Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday.

That's sort of the big, ethical shower we're all going to need to take post-Hillary Clinton State Department,"" she said, touting portions of Trump's speech. Trump also proposed a series of reforms that include term limits of six years for House and Senate members. That would've meant Trump running mate Mike Pence would've been term-limited out of office halfway through his 12-year tenure representing Indiana. ""He was definitely living in the swamp,"" Conway said of Pence, who led fiscal conservative fights like opposing the bank bailout pushed by his own party's President George W. Bush. ""Mike Pence would agree with Donald Trump on that: When you're there for too long, you need that fresh blood and new perspective,"" Conway said. ""I wish there were more members like Mike Pence. If there were, we wouldn't need to have the conversation."" Conway also attacked Clinton over her family foundation's acceptance of foreign contributions -- but Tapper pointed out that those details are public because the Clinton Foundation has published lists of its donors, while Trump hasn't released his tax returns. Tapper said: ""We have no idea what his ties are and where there might be moneyed interests and conflicts of interest because he won't disclose his tax returns."" Conway responded: ""Here's what we do know: We know that -- as he said yesterday in Gettysburg, Jake -- he used to be an insider. He's somebody who breathed rarefied air right up there with the Clintons and others, given his position, his power and his wealth and his great success as a businessman.

The new poll was conducted following the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump makes lewd comments about women. The poll of 740 likely voters, conducted Oct. 10-13, has a 4-percentage-point margin of error. Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they believe that the Republican presidential nominee likely made unwanted sexual advances. Most also said his apology was insincere. More than half of all respondents, 64 percent, said the tape make a difference in their votes.|2022-10-07 20:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|The Observer|381132|49157|312|5528|Spain|English|2022-09-26 22:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|3157200|2214000|1015|5.2

4723|“He and I Haven’t Spoken”: Trump and Pence Are Having a Very Public Couple’s Argument|In the middle of a heated exchange about the Syrian civil war during the second presidential debate Sunday night, Donald Trump dropped a surprising new factoid about the relationship between him and Mike Pence: the Indiana policies represent his own, and the two apparently worked out their differences. When asked by moderator Martha Raddatz why his attitude towards involvement with the Assad regime directly contradicted comments at the vice-presidential debate last week, Trump brushed off his own running mate. He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree, said Trump. The dismissive words by Trump come at a time that the Republican presidential nominee and his running-mate are not on the best terms. The deeply-religious Pence reportedly became apoplectic when he learned about a video recording of Trump making vulgar comments about forcing himself on women, sending out a harshly-worded statement condemning his remarks. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them, he said, adding that he hoped that Trump would move on. comments during the town hall-style debate also hinted at a widening rift between Trump and Pence, the governor of Indiana, who had decided to use his time on stage at the vice presidential debate to defend a platform that was, at several points, the exact opposite of platform. calm and measured performance gave Republicans some relief, with several calling for him to replace Trump at the top of the ticket. That enthusiasm, which reportedly annoyed Trump, only intensified after the reveal of the Access Hollywood footage of lewd comments, and Pence was not at Trump Tower during the emergency meeting the billionaire convened Sunday before the debate. In the hours since the 2005 tape was made public, rumors have swirled that Pence could abandon the Republican presidential ticket, though the speculation may have more basis in wishful thinking than reality. Shortly after the debate, however, Pence seemed more than open to reconciliation: For more Hive coverage of the second presidential debate, read T.A. look at Trump reveling in historic lows, watch Trump hover over shoulder, defend his Muslim ban and break with his own running mate, find out how the candidates answered the final question, and get the scoop on Melania interesting sartorial choice.|2022-09-30 17:00:00|REAL|Lucas Kim|Sunrise Chronicle|584621|77567|692|8874|Uganda|English|2022-09-10 04:00:00|Columna|1|True|766800|2541600|2298|11.533333333333333

480|First take: A great jobs report for investors|"The jobs report met expectations for once, and that's good news for stock and bond investors. The U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists missed by just a whisker: The consensus from Action Economics was 225,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate, at 5.4%, would be the lowest since May 2008. For once, there wasn't much to hate about the jobs report. Stock investors liked the signs of a growing economy. For example, construction added 45,000 jobs, and those are good jobs that pay well. ""That's a very good sign for things to come,"" says Joanie Courtney, senior vice president, market development at  And the bond market, which is usually only happy when it rains, rallied on the report as well. The bellwether 10-year Treasury note yield fell to 2.19% in early trading. It wasn't all puppies and unicorns.The March report was revised down strongly, to 85,000 jobs from 126,000. Manufacturing added just 1,000 jobs, and the oil sector lost 3,000 jobs. Because all investment questions these days seem to revolve around when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, the April report didn't add much pressure to the Fed to nudge its key fed funds rate higher. You need strong wage increases to create a wage/price spiral, and the 0.1% increase in hourly wages wasn't strong. ""I'm surprised we're not seeing more movement in wages,"" Courtney says. ""Usually in a recovery, you start to see more movement."" But the April report looks only at hourly wages, and not the wages of salaried workers. For investors, then, the April jobs report was the best of all possible worlds. It showed decent hiring, but nothing so exuberant that would push the Fed to tap the brakes."|2022-10-08 14:00:00|REAL|Gabriel Santos|Morning Star|163049|3415|388|4529|Thailand|English|2022-09-05 06:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|3222000|342000|1726|6.466666666666667
4810|Ballot Access: Another Way Dems and the GOP Screw Third Parties|"A multi-party system is normal,"" says Richard Winger, publisher and editor of Ballot Access News. ""You only have a two party system if there's repression. It's not natural."" With both major parties offering up two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history, many voters (and the media) are paying more attention to third party options such as Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. But while independent candidates are gaining in popularity, getting them on the ballot to vote for them can be a long and costly process. ""There's so many ways in which the United States is near the bottom of democracy,"" says Winger, an expert in election law and ballot access. ""There's been unbelievable hostility in the last few months to minor parties."" This hostility has resulted in states changing their ballot access at the last an effort to exclude minor parties from the ballot. One recent example of this was Gary Johnson's fight to remain on the ballot as a presidential candidate in Ohio after the secretary of state threatened to remove his name thanks to a frequently used rule that allows placeholder candidates when fulfilling ballot access requirements (read more about the incident here.) ""Ohio law explicitly says people who use the independent candidate petition procedure put a substitution committee on the petition,"" states Winger. But when it came time to remove the placeholder name and add Gary Johnson's, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted ""acted like he never heard of such a thing!"" Winger exclaimed. Johnson eventually qualified for the ballot as an independent candidate after his supporters turned in the necessary 5,000 petition signatures to Husted in late August. ""They act like the secretary of state did the Libertarians a big favor by letting them use this thing which has been used all along,"" Winger says. ""It's just so maddening."" Reason TV recently sat down with Winger to discuss which states have the worst ballot access laws, why the major parties give independent candidates such a hard time when it comes to getting on the ballot, and the consequences of a two party duopoly. ""This is one the things that anchors me being a libertarian,"" says Winger. ""Before the government got involved in printing ballots we had total freedom."" Produced by Alexis Garcia.

4813|The worst election ever|Dragging on for an excruciating eternity, this election season has demeaned democracy, elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable: Intellectually, with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance; ethically, with a complete disregard for integrity and character; and morally, driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriol. Given that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder, and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera , it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse, bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonk. But what's doubly disappointing -- as we head into the crucial presidential debates -- is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates, but also by the topics they gravitate to, which the media frenzy then exacerbates. These are topics that don't matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country: the size of a candidate's hands (and therefore other body parts), the now-moot birther issue, the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals, the name-calling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom, who is healthier than whom.|2022-09-13 20:00:00|REAL|Owen Rodriguez|The Reporter|895375|10997|44|6256|Japan|English|2022-09-09 17:00:00|Opinión del lector|0|True|727200|1083600|1312|0.7333333333333333

On Sunday morning, Clinton abruptly left a Sept. 11 commemoration ceremony in New York City. Her campaign later said she had ""felt overheated."" NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro reports that Clinton was scheduled to travel to California on Monday for two days, but late Sunday night her campaign called off the events. Domenico adds: The ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center site marked the 15th anniversary of the attacks. Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said that Clinton attended ""to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen."" Clinton departed without warning, as NPR's Tamara Keith tells our Newscast unit. ""Her traveling press corps was not taken with her and didn't know her whereabouts for quite some time,"" she says. Video published on Twitter shows Clinton being assisted into a van. She appears to be unsteady on her feet and wobbles on her way into the vehicle. About 90 minutes after arriving at her daughter's apartment, Clinton emerged, walking without assistance, waving to the crowd. ""I'm feeling great,"" she said. ""It's a beautiful day in New York."" According to the National Weather Service, the temperature was 79 degrees with 54 percent humidity at 9:51 a.m. in Manhattan.

""Clinton was the senior-most advocate for using the U.S. military to bring ill-fated regime change in Libya and, further, failed to anticipate the chaos that would follow,"" Gates, who has served eight presidents over 50 years, wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. ""The same failure she and other Democrats hung around the neck of the Bush 43 administration in post-Saddam Iraq."" Regarding Trump, ""when it comes to credibility problems, though, Donald Trump is in a league of his own,"" Gates said. ""He has expressed support for building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico; for torturing suspected terrorists and killing their families; for [Vladimir] dictatorial leadership and for Saddam nonexistent successes against terrorism."" Gates, who most-recently worked under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, sized up the candidates on a variety of global national security issues from China to North Korea, to Iran to Russia. ""Our new president had best be prepared for an early test of U.S. resolve in the Persian Gulf and continuing regional subversion,"" Gates said. Though he has serious concerns with both candidates, Clinton fares slightly better than Trump, he said. ""Clinton has time before the election to address forthrightly her trustworthiness, to reassure people about her judgment, to demonstrate her willingness to stake out one or more positions on national security at odds with her conventional wisdom, and to speak beyond generalities about how she would deal with China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, the Middle East and international trade. ""Whether and how she addresses these issues will, I believe, affect how many people vote me,"" he said. However, Trump ""is beyond repair"" on national security issues, Gates said.

4882|Gary Johnson snags newspaper endorsement|"Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson received the endorsement of a prominent Virginia paper in an editorial posted Saturday night, notching a Labor Day weekend win for his third party bid. The glowing appraisal of Johnson's candidacy by the Richmond Times-Dispatch's editorial board contrasts the former New Mexico governor with Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic standard-bearer Hillary Clinton, both of whom lack the proper character traits to be president, the paper said. ""Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton meets the fundamental moral and professional standards we have every right to expect of an American president,"" the editorial board writes. The editorial board's backing of Johnson is also a break in its partisan leanings, as it has endorsed Republican candidates in every presidential election for the past 36 years. Johnson performed poorly in Virginia during his 2012 effort, securing less than one percent of the state's vote . The ex-governor has said he hopes to break out this year due to the low favorability ratings for Trump and Clinton, and the paper followed that line of thinking. The editorial also called for Johnson to join the nationally-televised debates alongside Trump and Clinton. The former governor has said repeatedly that he needs to make the general election debates to have any realistic chance at the White House. The presidential debate commission requires a candidate to reach an average of 15 percent in the polls it has selected. Johnson must rapidly improve his position to meet this threshold. CNN's latest poll of polls found Johnson sitting at an average of 9 percent nationwide, and a Quinnipiac poll from mid-August had Johnson at 12 percent in Virginia."|2022-10-10 05:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|City Times|474110|49934|322|7441|Thailand|English|2022-09-03 00:00:00|Crítica|1|True|3362400|147600|1731|5.366666666666666

Given that the Democratic/Republican-controlled ""nonpartisan"" Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) will choose the debate roster in mid-September based on a five-agency polling average that currently sits at 8.8 percent, well short of the required 15 percent, for Johnson, the irresistible force of the LP's debate-centric focus has been on a collision course with the immovable object of the CPD's unreasonably high threshold. Until, it seems, this afternoon. No matter how much independent-bent political celebrities such as Mitt Romney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Mitch Daniels support the L.P. ticket being included in the debates, and no matter how much that motion is seconded by solid majorities of the American voting public, rules are rules, and when said rules are written by the Republican and Democratic parties, Libertarians are screwed. Unless, vice presidential nominee William Weld told me this afternoon, the mounting outrage at the ""rigged"" system is married to the sight of the two candidates outside every debate venue, making a mockery of the proceedings inside by answering every question simultaneously, only better: ""So I'm no longer so sure that it's game over if we're not in the debates,"" Weld told me. ""I think there's going to be kind of a national uproar if we're not in the debates, and we will join in that uproar, and be standing together on the street corner outside every debate venue answering the same questions as in the debate in real time, you know, putting it out on Facebook Live."" Weld made the same promise during his address at a midtown Manhattan rally this afternoon, which was attended by 500-plus enthusiastic supporters. ""We've seen that the little videos that we record in 90 seconds are seen by 15, 18 million people in a matter of less than two weeks,"" he told me, ""so that kind of free media attention might continue all the way from now until November 8th as a result of our exclusion.

4909|Bill Clinton suggests Trump slogan racist – but he used the same one|"Former President Bill Clinton might want to keep the racism accusations to himself from now on -- after ripping Donald Trump for a slogan he's used repeatedly since his 'Comeback Kid' days. The 42nd president on Wednesday, while stumping in Orlando for Hillary Clinton, suggested campaign rallying cry, Make America Great Again, is racist code. actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they all that good in many ways, Clinton said. That message where give you America great is if a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, you? The crowd roared as Clinton continued. What it means is give you an economy you had 50 years ago, and move you back up on the social totem pole and other people he said. The problem is, Clinton himself has used the same phrase several times in the past. He used it repeatedly while running for president in 1991 and 1992, declaring at one Little Rock, Ark., event, ""Together, we can make America great again."" And in a campaign ad for his wife in 2008, Bill Clinton said, ""It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again."" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pointed to the inconvenient footage in calling the former president's allegations about Trump's slogan a ""disgrace.""

491|Walgreens to close 200 stores, boost cost cutting|"Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) announced plans to close about 200 U.S. stores as part of its first earnings report since it merged with European drug retailer Alliance Boots last year. Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, said it will close the stores amid plans to boost its previously announced cost-cutting initiative by $500 million. Walgreens expects to reduce costs by a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, the company said. ""After a rigorous analysis, the company has identified additional opportunities for cost savings, primarily in its Retail Pharmacy USA division,"" the company said Thursday. ""Significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 USA stores; reorganize corporate and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions."" Walgreens' spokesman Philip Caruso said the company has not yet decided which stores it will close, but it is ""not focusing on any specific geographic area."" Caruso also said there is ""no hard timeline"" for when the stores will be closed during the period for cost cutting. The soon-to-be closed stores make up roughly 2% of the Walgreens' 8,232 drugstores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Walgreens also said it opened 71 new drugstores in this region in the first half of fiscal 2015, including 25 relocations. Store closings aside, Walgreens wowed shareholders with strong earnings. Shares jumped $4.94, or 5.6%, to $92.62. Walgreens said adjusted second-quarter net earnings increased 33.2% to $1.2 billion. Second-quarter sales, meanwhile, increased 35.5% to $26.6 billion. The U.S. retail pharmacy division, which includes Walgreens and Duane Reade stores, posted sales in the second quarter of $21 billion, up 7.4% over the year-ago quarter. Total sales in stores open at least a year were up 6.9% over the same quarter a year ago. In December, Walgreens closed on a deal, valued at close to $16 billion, to purchase the remaining stake of European health and beauty retailer Alliance Boots that it didn't already own. The new company, which includes more than 12,800 stores in 11 countries, was renamed Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., and it took on ticker symbol WBA."|2022-10-05 22:00:00|REAL|Samantha Chen|The Pulse|119951|30378|142|6988|Sudan|English|2022-09-11 16:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|896400|2991600|2261|2.3666666666666667

4927|Why Not Vote Third Party? We Asked California Voters.|In an election year in which the two mainstream candidates are disliked at never-before-seen levels, might there be an opportunity for third party candidates? Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Darrell Castle of the Constitution Party are seeing more interest in their parties' nominees than ever before, and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson is polling close to double-digits, higher than any other third party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. We hit the streets of Los Angeles and the campus of UCLA to ask voters whether they'd consider voting third party this year and to administer the isidewith.com test, an online quiz that shows you which candidate is your ideological match based on your answers to a series of questions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many people's matches weren't consistent with the candidate for whom they planned to vote. In this solidly blue state, most voters we talked to plan to cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton, with varying levels of enthusiasm. But while a few committed Clinton partisans seemed unlikely to budge, we found that many folks identified as independents, a trend consistent with data that points to fewer and fewer Americans affiliating with the major parties. And these self-described independents were more willing to at least hear out the third party candidates. In fact, a recent Quinnipiac poll found that 62 percent of Americans want Gary Johnson on the debate stage, despite the fact that the Commission on Presidential Debates sets the polling cutoff at 15 percent. So what would it take for these independent-minded voters to pull the lever for someone other than Clinton or Trump? Watch the video above to find out.

496|Nearly 300K New Jobs In February; Unemployment Dips To 5.5 Percent|"Nearly 300K New Jobs In February; Unemployment Dips To 5.5 Percent The U.S. economy added 295,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department's monthly survey, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5 percent. The latest strong data beat expectations and follow a robust jump the previous month a sign that the nation's economy is finally picking up steam. Economists had predicted the economy would add 240,000 jobs in February and that the unemployment rate would notch back down to 5.6 percent, where it stood for December. The slight increase in the rate last month was attributed to strong growth in the labor force. The average workweek for nonfarm payrolls was 34.6 hours, a figure that has held steady for five months. The average hourly wage rose 3 cents, to $24.78. As NPR's John Ydstie reported this morning ahead of this morning's release by the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the report for January ""was stellar on almost every count. It revealed a monthly average for job growth of 336,000 over the previous three months, and it showed strong wage gains after years of disappointing growth."" For February, the Labor Department says more jobs were added in food services and drinking places, professional and business services, construction, health care and in transportation and warehousing. The latest report comes as the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is likely to raise interest rates, possibly as soon as June, based on the generally more robust U.S. economy and concerns about inflation pressures. Today's reports shows 51,000 new jobs last month in professional and business services and 29,000 new jobs in construction. Transportation and warehousing added 19,000 jobs, and the retail sector gained 32,000. Over the past year, construction and retail have collectively gained about 320,000 jobs.

4966|William Weld: Never Mind Libertarianism, He's Running as Himself|"Boston magazine has a long take on William Weld, former Massachusetts governor, currently Libertarian vice presidential candidate. The main takeaway, after some of the usual slightly sneery scene-setting about weirdo libertarians (reported from July's FreedomFest in Las Vegas) and the lovely color detail of the patrician Weld being amazed he's staying in a New York hotel whose price is three digits beginning with ""one""? That while Weld totally thinks of himself as libertarian and has for a long time, he's also a guy who just likes to do strange and challenging things as a lark, like writing novels, and hates being bored and likes being in the political mix. An unnamed former adviser says ""There's nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody else's dime, flying first class, and talking to political reporters all day."" Another unnamed former staffer says of Weld ""He is old money, white, and fucking brilliant...Everybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office, and he always embraced them and made them his own."" Reason has written quite a bit on some conflicts between Weld and libertarianism as most define it, despite Weld's long-time affection for that self-identification, and this profile is decent on explaining that aspect of the Weld/Libertarian story. The profile by Simon van Zuylen-Wood sums up that conflict: Weld's strategy isn't to try to defend libertarian ideas. Instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear. When Johnson suggests abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Weld raises an eyebrow and clarifies that he wouldn't go that far. When asked about gun control, Weld suggests the a million Libertarians choking on their a massive new FBI task force.... .... I ask him, at random, about climate change. He advocates pragmatic, mainstream, and essentially unlibertarian ideas about the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius. These aren't ideas his free-market brethren take kindly to. He smiles. He doesn't care: ""I'm running as myself.""

""Hillary Clinton is the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo,"" Trump wrote. ""The Clintons have spent decades as insiders lining their own pockets and taking care of donors instead of the American people."" Over the weekend, the Clinton campaign insisted the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting donations from foreign countries. They did not explain why such a suspension did not happen when Clinton served as secretary of state. Critics have pointed to a number of State Department-facilitated deals that involved foreign parties that had made donations to the Clinton Foundation. The 'Clinton system' involves selling access to bad guys. ""What they were doing during Crooked Hillary's time as Secretary of State was wrong then, and it is wrong now,"" Trump wrote. Earlier this year, the FBI reportedly wanted to open an investigation of the Clinton Foundation after receiving an alert from a bank about suspicious activity by a foreign Clinton Foundation donor, but the Department of Justice (DOJ) nixed it, claiming their own investigation after the book Clinton Cash (now a documentary)was released could not substantiate those allegations the DOJ focused on."|2022-10-02 07:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|The Pulse|644835|40864|301|822|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-08 09:00:00|Entrevista|0|True|2678400|612000|1352|5.016666666666667

Rigell, who has announced he will not run for re-election this year in his Virginia district, is the second Republican member of Congress to announce that he'll vote for someone other than Trump. Retiring New York Rep. Richard Hanna wrote in an op-ed for Syracuse.com this week that he'll instead back Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Rigell's announcement came in an interview with The New York Times published on Saturday, and Kaylin Minton, a spokeswoman for Rigell, confirmed the report's accuracy to CNN. Hanna and Rigell's defections come as other notable Republicans have said they will either not vote for Trump or will back other candidates. Earlier this week, longtime Chris Christie aide Maria Comella told CNN's Jamie Gangel she plans to vote for Clinton , and Sally Bradshaw, Jeb Bush's top adviser, told Gangel she's leaving the Republican Party over Trump and will vote for Clinton in Florida if the race there is close. And major GOP donor Meg Whitman announced earlier this week she'll support Clinton over Trump as well. Amid Republican infighting over its anti-establishment nominee, the Clinton and Johnson campaigns have sought to grow their bases of support. For example, Whitman said she backed Clinton following a direct phone call from the former secretary of state.

Among his ideas were the following proposals: Trump also took some time to slam Clinton's economic plans, saying she punished Americans for working and doing business in the United States. Clinton wasted no time firing back, calling Trump's plans a re-packaging of old Republican ideas. ""Today in Detroit he's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named. Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve,"" Clinton told supporters at a campaign rally in Kissimmee, Florida. ""They wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit.

By selecting a nominee that does not reflect the usual fiscal policies, a victory for Trump will mean a shift in the focus. Even if the rest of the GOP holds fast to the platform or to traditional conservative values, the policies always reshape the party. If you have ever promoted a local candidate to voters, you know this is true the public looks at the top of the ticket first and judges the party by that views. Many Trump supporters will see his win as a referendum on their policies and will work to make the party reflect that. Fellow Republicans will either need to accept that or leave. We have no idea what a Trump presidency will look like, but based on his campaign, it will be filled with outrageous gaffes, inarticulate interviews on policy and offensive media blitzes focused on non-issues. Trump will most likely lose minorities and women, creating a wider divide that the GOP must bridge in the future. Many young voters will continue to associate Trump with the party long after he leaves office. This would only further damage Republicans and set us up for heavy losses in 2018. Not to mention the party will continue to hemorrhage its best and brightest. Candidates, staff and volunteers have already walked away from Trump, and no question it will keep happening. If Trump gains a greater control of the party, these people might even be forced out. But say Trump win and Hillary Clinton claims the White House. If Trump only trails her by a few points, you can bet he will blame the Republicans who voted their conscience. Or kick up dirt over the rigged system, as he has already alluded to.

But I'm not sure they succeeded in seeming very Libertarian, or selling the Party's position as a distinct outlook on politics and government that someone could grasp and understand. They often seemed to go out of their way to just seem like a centrist, independent mixture of what someone might see as good aspects of both other parties. In fact, when host Anderson Cooper would occasionally remind the candidates what the traditional libertarian stance was, often relying on the Party platform, he might have done more to sell libertarianism's unique stances than the candidates. Herewith, a (not necessarily comprehensive) list of places where a Libertarian might have been frustrated with the candidates tonight, with a few (again, not comprehensive) nods to when they got it closer to right. The emphasis, though, will be on the disappointments, which dominated in my eyes. The two governors mostly seemed thoughtful, humble, decent, not aggravating control freaks or rampaging ids. They did not seem like bold representatives of a distinct philosophy and practice of government, one with a well-developed philosophy about what government is for, and why.|2022-10-10 09:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|Metro News|809241|34568|394|7670|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-25 03:00:00|Columna de humor|0|True|2059200|3376800|1439|6.566666666666666

The Republican nominee is still under fire for how he reacted over the weekend to the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. Khizr Khan blasted Trump at the Democratic convention, noting that unlike his fallen son, Trump has ""sacrificed nothing and no one."" Unwilling to the let the insult pass, Trump hit back, implying that Khan's wife wasn't allowed to speak during her husband's DNC address because of the family's Muslim faith. The GOP nominee's remarks have sparked outrage from veterans and members of his own party. ""While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,"" war hero Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said. Trump's campaign is now appealing to GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill to help quell the controversy. Meanwhile, a mother whose son was killed in the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, is also speaking out. Patricia Smith criticized Clinton at the Republican convention, noting that she has received much different treatment than the Khan family. ""I was treated like dirt.

Meanwhile on the campaign trail, Clinton attacked Trump's tax cut plan, and again called on him to release his tax returns. ""And while we're at it, we would like to see those tax returns wouldn't we? My husband and I put out, I think about 33 or 34 years' worth, if you're interested,"" Clinton pointed out. Trump alleges that former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., made a deal with the devil to endorse Clinton. ""If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relaxed, he would have been a hero, but he made a deal with the devil. She's the devil. He made a deal with the devil,"" Trump said. There's still a long way to go until Election Day and many of today's controversies could easily be forgotten by November. Clinton's poll bounce could fade as bounces often do, turning this into a tight race once again."|2022-09-27 20:00:00|REAL|Maxwell Rivera|National Courier|626412|30041|254|2972|Myanmar|English|2022-09-23 06:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2293200|1897200|2334|4.233333333333333
506|Gas prices aren't forever, Obama tells Americans|"That was President Barack Obama's message to American consumers on Tuesday as he discussed near six year-low gas prices in an interview with The Detroit News ahead of a visit to Michigan on Wednesday to tout the recovery of the auto industry and the growth of American manufacturing. ""I would strongly advise American consumers to continue to think about how you save money at the pump because it is good for the environment, it's good for family pocketbooks and if you go back to old habits and suddenly gas is back at $3.50, you are going to not be real happy,"" Obama said. But instead of returning to ""old habits,"" Obama advised Americans to save their money, ""or better yet"" use the savings to buy a new car, for example. He said Americans should ""not believe that"" gas prices won't rise again, explaining that demand for oil in booming countries like China and India will continue to rise, kicking costs back up. Oil prices have dropped more than 50% in recent months, falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2009 on Monday. Many members of Congress are counting on gas prices to remain low, however, as they hope to use the low prices as an opportunity to increase the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades. As he touts the results of his bailout of the auto industry on Wednesday, Obama will also promote fuel efficiency at the Ford plant he is set to visit, which produces alternative fuel vehicles and small cars, The News reported. Obama gave the newspaper a preview of his speech Wednesday, in which he is expected to tout the resurgence of the auto industry and the boom of American manufacturing -- two key points of his plan for economic recovery, and elements he hopes will become a part of his legacy as president. ""The auto industry has led a resurgence of manufacturing in America,"" Obama said. ""The quality of the cars has gotten so much better that we are competitive not just in SUVs but up and down the line. The branding of American cars is back to where it should be. Michigan's unemployment rate has fallen faster than the overall employment rate."|2022-10-01 04:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|The Insight|993092|4972|169|7223|Iran|English|2022-09-20 13:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|1663200|2581200|2098|2.816666666666667
5066|Will Bill Clinton's best effort be enough?|"Ed Morrissey is senior editor at  a columnist for The Week and The Fiscal Times, and author of ""Going Red: The Two Million Voters Who Will Elect the Next President -- and How Conservatives Can Win Them."" The views expressed are his own. Traditionally, the spouses of major-party nominees get a speaking slot at the national convention to humanize the candidate. Former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history. Bill Clinton falls into both categories, but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday night; he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again. That's a tall order, and not just because the evening started with a walkout involving hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates, according to one estimate . A generation has passed since the former president ascended to lead the Democratic Party as the first baby boomer major-party nominee, and then defeated the last of the World War II presidents. Back then, Bill used his enormous natural political talent to fuse the New Left with working class Democrats, while ""triangulating"" on the Republican agenda to carve a centrist path in governance. Twenty-four years later, it's not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. It might not be Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party. If it hadn't been for the establishment-protecting superdelegates and the Democratic National Convention's efforts to tip the primary scales in her favor, it would likely have been Bernie Sanders' Democratic Party -- and on Tuesday in Philadelphia, with hundreds of empty seats staring back at the stage, it certainly looked as though it was. Twenty-four years later, Bill Clinton isn't the same, youthful physical force, either. At times he seemed frail and at one point a bit distracted. However, Clinton proved that his political instincts haven't dimmed much at all. Rather than take on the task of unifying through direct debate, Clinton delivered a masterful soft-sell by walking through a personal history of his wife that tried to answer the divides in the party."|2022-10-02 02:00:00|REAL|Alexander Lee|The Pulse|996400|64676|329|3847|Thailand|English|2022-09-06 17:00:00|Entrevista|1|True|468000|2660400|2097|5.483333333333333
51|Bernie Sanders’s vast universe of donors, mapped|Something interesting happened for Hillary Clinton in the third quarter of fundraising: Her fundraising centers softened. During the second quarter, Clinton outraised Bernie Sanders handily, thanks to a lot of big-dollar donors. In the third quarter, the two were about tied. But look at how Clinton's donors were arrayed during the third quarter versus the second. In the second quarter, Clinton received donations from about 5,300 ZIP codes. In the third quarter, that increased to 6,300. That second quarter, when Clinton wrung a lot of money out of a lot of people, she pulled in a lot of money from Manhattan's wealthiest ZIP codes. In those ZIPs, roughly 10021 through 10028, Clinton raised $2 million from individuals in the second quarter. In the third quarter, she raised $725,000 -- a $1.3 million drop. (The densest area of circles below is Manhattan; you can also see the outline of Long Island to New York City's east.) Notice how centralized her donations were in the second quarter compared to Sanders's. He got a lot more contributions from outlying ZIP codes. This is what you'd expect to see from a candidate who got a lot of donors to max out early. Those areas subsequently have fewer donors to hit up. But you might also have noticed how much better Sanders is doing in the lucrative New York market. Across the country, Sanders dramatically expanded the number of places from which he generated contributions, more than doubling the number of ZIP codes from which he got money from 3,400 to 8,400. Sanders also saw an increase in how much he raised, versus the decrease Clinton experienced. We return to this chart that we published earlier this month. Sanders has a lot more people now to whom he can go back for more money.|2022-09-29 13:00:00|REAL|Jacob Gupta|Global Gazette|211416|47140|57|0|Argentina|English|2022-09-24 20:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|0|True|2034000|2440800|1747|0.95

5142|Trump Expected to Name Running Mate Soon: Looking for an 'Attack Dog'|"Donald Trump has just five days until the Republican National Convention begins in Cleveland, Ohio, and many expect he will name his running mate by the end of this week. Among the frontrunners right now: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Pence introduced Trump at an Indianapolis rally Tuesday night and compared him to Ronald Reagan. ""I think he is someone who has connected with everyday Americans like no one since Ronald Reagan,"" Pence said of Trump. According to CNN, a Trump source says that Pence has already passed a major hurdle, noting that his vetting ""was completely clean and that mattered. No one needs an extra hassle."" CBN Chief Political Correspondent David Brody says Pence is a ""solid movement conservative"" and that most evangelical leaders would support a Pence pick, despite his ""religious liberty misstep"" in Indiana. On Tuesday, Fox News reported that it is suspending Gingrich's contract since the former speaker is also a vice presidential contender. Gingrich would bring years of Capitol Hill experience to the ticket and has publicly campaigned for Trump for months. Trump told the Wall Street Journal this week that he's looking for an ""attack dog"" in his running mate. That person would help him fend off attacks from Democrats, the media, fellow Republicans, and even Supreme Court justices. Meanwhile, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken out against Trump in a series of interviews, recently calling him among other things ""unqualified"" to serve as president. Trump hit back overnight, tweeting that ""Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot--resign!"" Even Democrats have chided Ginsburg, noting that justices historically have kept out of politics. On the Democratic campaign trail, Bernie Sanders gave his long-awaited endorsement to Hillary Clinton Tuesday night in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It comes after party platform talks, a process that Sanders wanted to influence. With the platform including a $15-an-hour minimum wage and tougher restrictions on Wall Street, it looks like he did. For now, with the Republican convention coming up before the Democratic convention, the focus is on Trump and who will be on the ticket with him in the race for the White House."|2022-10-01 04:00:00|REAL|Caleb Shah|Voice of the Nation|721771|2547|185|5696|Vietnam|English|2022-09-05 15:00:00|Crónica|0|True|374400|2581200|2361|3.0833333333333335
5143|Donald Trump's run: He was just the man he was waiting for|Before he decided to run for office, political donations were a cost of doing business, suggesting that his practice of politics was transactional, not ideological. He hosted fundraisers and invited politicians to weddings. I give to everybody. When they call, I give, Trump said. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later I call them. They are there for me. Trump and his major companies gave at least $3.1 million to local, state and federal candidates from both parties between 1995 and 2016, not including donations that may have flowed through the scores of limited-liability corporations that Trump controlled. He donated to Hillary Clinton when she was running to be a U.S. senator from New York. Asked if he voted for her, Trump said: I never say who going to vote for. He did say in a separate interview, however, that his votes for president were consistently Republican. Although he said he lost respect for the younger President Bush because of his handling of the war in Iraq, which he later called a disaster, he said he voted for Bush again in 2004 because he felt it was important to carry the Republican line. Recalling the 2004 vote, Trump said he showed his distance from Bush by not throwing fundraisers for him. public statements sent mixed signals about his political leanings. In 2006, he told the New York Times that Sen. John McCain, who would become the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, could not win because he advocated sending more troops to Iraq. Trump praised the future Democratic nominee, then-Sen. Barack Obama, for his wonderful qualities. Nonetheless, Trump contributed $3,600 to McCain during the 2008 campaign and said he voted for him. Trump changed parties seven times between 1999 and 2012, starting when he left the GOP to consider a run under the Reform Party banner. After registering as a Democrat in 2001, he switched back to the Republicans in 2003. He became a Democrat again in 2005 and a Republican in 2009. He chose not to be affiliated with any party in 2011. Asked what he would say to critics who saw the constant party-switching as proof that he had no core beliefs, Trump responded: I think it had to do more with practicality because if going to run for office, you would have had to make friends. Then he returned to the GOP in 2012, once again stoking speculation that he had his sights on the presidency.|2022-09-08 15:00:00|REAL|Caleb Shah|Morning Star|715611|31858|427|2923|Russia|English|2022-09-05 23:00:00|Artículo de investigación|1|True|633600|403200|2413|7.116666666666666

Topping their list is Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. Moore referred to Trump's campaign as ""reality television moral sewage.""

5167|Evangelical Leader: Trump Campaign Broken from the Inside|"The Trump campaign is coming apart from the inside, according to Regent University's Dr. Gerson Moreno-Riano, and only the days ahead will show whether the candidate can bring people together, not only in his inner circle, but in the Republican Party. Regent Univerity's Dr. Gerson Moreno-Riano talks more about Trump's challenge with Evangelicals. Watch above. Trump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Monday amid reports of disagreements and infighting among the staff. ""I think what's happened with the Trump campaign is, I think it's fractured itself internally,"" Moreno-Riano said. ""I think that it is trying to meet a number of different objectives and keep a number of constituencies very, very happy and it has been unable to do so."" ""And I think this is just symptomatic of a broader, a more deeper problem within the American electorate, particularly GOP evangelicals,"" he added. Moreno-Riano said the test for Trump is to find a way to bring his message under control and highlight the core concerns of GOP constituencies, including evangelicals. ""The dilemma has always been whether Trump himself has what I'll call the internal character-based resources to pull this off,"" he explained. ""He is a man who is very direct, very strong-minded and the question is: Does he have enough discipline, both personally and professionally, enough political discipline to pull this off? I think at the end of the day, it's his question to answer."" The decision to fire his campaign manager comes just one day before Trump is set to meet with hundreds of evangelical leaders in New York City to answer their questions and lay to rest the many concerns they have about his conservative -- and Christian -- bona fides. Moreno-Riano listed abortion, religious liberty, and the Supreme Court as some of the most important issues he can address in the meeting, including the question, ""Are you truly someone who understands the evangelical mindset -- those areas of deep concern?"" But he pointed out evangelicals themselves are not united. They need to ""bring unity to the table and I just don't see that,"" he said. Since the 1950s evangelicals have failed to rally around any candidate and ""that's too big a burden to place on Trump,"" he said. ""I think they're going to try to assess whether he's truly evangelical or not, so it's a big challenge for him to try and unite them around a common denominator. That's going to be difficult."|2022-09-28 07:00:00|REAL|Ava Murphy|Express Tribune|592228|14012|370|2115|Iran|English|2022-09-15 14:00:00|Reseña|1|True|2332800|1234800|2436|6.166666666666667
5178|Poll: Clinton's Lead Over Trump Slips After Florida Shooting|"The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That's down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States. He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party's general opposition to gun control. While Trump's comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters. Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump's idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014. Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called ""radical jihadist terrorism,"" while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. As usual after a major attack, ""terrorism"" jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues. The poll's five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton's support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump's 32.3 percent. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll's accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points."|2022-10-09 05:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|Daily Beacon|553556|14368|349|5587|Egypt|English|2022-09-13 10:00:00|Reportaje|0|True|3276000|1047600|2497|5.816666666666666

""I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country,"" Trump said on CBS' Face The Nation. While adding that ""I hate the concept of profiling,"" Trump said that ""we have to start using common sense and we have to use, you know, we have to use our heads."" Profiling is an oft-criticized law enforcement tactic. The National Institute of Justice -- the research and development of the Justice Department -- defined racial profiling as a ""practice that targets people for suspicion of crime based on their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin."" African-Americans and Hispanics have long protested police profiling that ranges from traffic stops to questioning about alleged crimes. Trump has stepped up comments about ""radical Islamic extremism"" in the wake of last week's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and his proposals have drawn criticism from opponents. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the Muslim migration ban and other proposals would help the Islamic State and other extremists recruit new members, and alienate Muslim nations who are helping the U.S. fight terrorism. Trump's approach ""is un-American,"" Clinton said last week. ""It goes against everything we stand for as a country founded on religious freedom. But it is also dangerous."" In his CBS interview, Trump said Israel and other nations use profiling. ""We're not using common sense,"" he said."|2022-10-11 00:00:00|REAL|Amelia Rivera|World News Network|425671|58264|86|9493|Colombia|English|2022-09-29 02:00:00|Análisis|1|True|3430800|2401200|1638|1.4333333333333333
518|Gundlach: Trump Would Use Debt Like Reagan for Growth|DoubleLine Jeffrey Gundlach said Donald Trump, if elected president, would help the U.S. economy recover by going further into debt, just as Ronald Reagan fueled growth in the 1980s. Trump is going to win, and Trump is going to increase the deficit, Gundlach said during a panel discussion Thursday in New York. Reagan did it by taking three or four decades of stable nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratio and putting it on a hockey stick higher. Gundlach, 56, endorsing any candidate, according to Loren Fleckenstein, a DoubleLine analyst. The fund manager, who has been predicting a Trump election victory since February, noted that campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, resembles Make America Great Again. Under Reagan, the U.S. debt grew to more than $2.3 trillion at the end of 1988 from $807 billion eight years earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total U.S. debt as of Dec. 31 was $15.1 trillion. Markets might not react favorably to a Trump election at first, because the Republican presidential candidate has criticized international trade agreements, according to the fund manager. First, I think going to get a global growth scare, trade-based, Gundlach said. That could cause a market rollover which to me looks like already under way. This retreat in the S&P 500 Index could be an excellent buying opportunity, Gundlach added, as the debt binge will probably stimulate growth, at least temporarily. The S&P 500 is down about 0.6 percent since victory Tuesday in the Indiana primary. His win prompted his two remaining Republican opponents, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, to suspend their campaigns. When I say Donald going to win, not that wildly rooting for him, although I dislike Donald Trump, Gundlach said in an interview with Fox Business Wall Street Week set to air Friday at 8 p.m. New York time. just like, I think going to happen. On the panel discussion, Gundlach said oil prices must get to $60 a barrel to avoid a wave of high-yield debt defaults, a price he expect to see soon. He predicted more junk-bond defaults when borrowers are forced to roll over debt in a rising interest-rate environment by 2018 or the following two years. Gundlach said he continues to be long on gold. Spot gold was trading at about $1,277 an ounce as of 6:48 p.m. Thursday in New York, up 20 percent this year. In January, Gundlach said he expected gold would climb to $1,400.|2022-09-21 07:00:00|REAL|Olivia Kumar|World News Network|566878|83293|202|7194|Italy|English|2022-09-06 04:00:00|Noticia destacada|1|True|421200|1728000|2421|3.3666666666666667

The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign, the campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement, according to the New York Times. The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future. According to NBC News, Trump called Lewandowski this morning to inform him of his firing after an emergency meeting with family members and top advisers to right the ship, and to plot a more serious campaign strategy. The announcement comes hours after an explosive GQ profile of Hicks revealed disturbing incidents of alleged abuse directed at the 27-year-old national press secretary from Lewandowski. You made a big f***ing mistake; f***ing dead to me, Lewandowski allegedly told Hicks after she expressed interest in leaving the campaign recently, bringing her to tears, according to former Trump operative Sam Nunberg. While Lewandowski denied reporting, the hotheaded campaign manager, of course, first grabbed the spotlight away from his boss when he was arrested for yanking a female Breitbart writer, an act he denied happened but was caught on camera. While the charges were eventually dropped, Trump remained loyal and committed to Lewandowski even as reports emerged that Lewandowski had a history of making abusive, sexist, and sexual remarks to his female coworkers.

5196|Protests Continue as Donald Trump Gears Up for the White House|"President Barack Obama and Republican leaders are rolling out the red carpet to help President-elect Donald Trump transition to the White House, but in several big cities, the election results are still being met with opposition on the streets. From Philadelphia and New York City to Oakland and Portland, Oregon, anti-Trump crowds flooded the streets for a second night of protests. In Portland, the situation was so bad that police declared it a riot. ""These people, unfortunately, have to get over the results. He won. He won,"" one resident said. Trump answered the protests with this tweet: The president-elect met with Obama for the first time at the White House Thursday, laying the groundwork for his transition into the Oval Office. ""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed,"" Obama told his successor. Congressional Republicans are also joining forces to help Trump succeed. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., gave Trump a tour of Capitol Hill, showing him exactly where he'll be sworn as the 45th president of the United States. ""We are now talking about how we are going to hit the ground running to make sure that we can get this country turned around and make America great again,"" Ryan said. Republicans are putting together an ambitious agenda for Trump's first 100 days in the White House. Trump is gearing up for a strong beginning to his presidency. With Republican support and control in the House and Senate, he has three key issues at the top of his list. ""We're going to look very strongly on immigration, health care and we're looking at jobs, big league jobs,"" he said. However, Trump will face extremely strong opposition from Democrats on key issues, like Obamacare. Additionally, one of his first and most important presidential decisions will be nominating a new justice to fill the late Antonin Scalia's place on the Supreme Court.

5210|Donald Trump is failing at basically everything right now. This poll proves it.|Donald Trump has had a very tough three weeks on the campaign trail, from a bad first debate to the Access Hollywood video to the recent flood of allegations that he groped and made unwanted sexual advances toward several women. And yet Trump trails Hillary Clinton by just four points in the new Washington Post-ABC News poll a number that is pretty par for the course for the 2016 election. But the Post-ABC poll also makes this clear about what Trump is up to these days: He's doing almost everything wrong, and he's doing nothing to grow his support and actually put himself in a position to win. Trump has spent the better part of the past week arguing that his comments on tape were just locker room talk, attempting to cast doubt on the accusations made against him by an increasing number of women and pressing the case that the Clintons' misdeeds are worse than the ones he's alleged to have committed. The problem is that a majority of voters are buying none of it. So why hasn't he lost much ground at least in this poll (other polls last week showed him losing much more and down double digits)? Part of it is rank partisanship. About 4 in 10 likely voters appear willing to give him a pass on most of the things described above. Those who appear unconcerned are largely GOP-leaning voters already supporting Trump. And that's probably why he remains at 43 percent in a four-way matchup with Hillary Clinton, Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein. But that brings us back to the problem that has plagued Trump since the GOP primary: his inability to grow his support among the general electorate. Trump is doing basically nothing in response to his problems these past few weeks that is being met with broad support. He has long run, and continues to run, a campaign that is very much focused on the Republican Party base, and that base doesn't seem to have deserted him at this point. But that base alone is also insufficient to win an election in the United States. Trump remains in this race almost completely despite himself and with an assist from Clinton's own popularity problems. Those are problems, we would note, that are largely due to things she did before this campaign in contrast to Trump. He'll probably see the head-to-head number from this poll showing him down only four points and think he's doing just fine and could still win. If so, he will be missing the point entirely.|2022-09-25 03:00:00|REAL|Olivia Kumar|Sunrise Chronicle|412937|68552|138|8202|South Africa|English|2022-09-24 05:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|2059200|1980000|2426|2.3

5224|With 3:20 a.m. tweet storm Saturday, Clinton continues to mock Trump’s Friday ‘meltdown’|WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. Not to be outdone by her Republican rival, Hillary Clinton fired off a series of early-morning messages Saturday on Twitter. Only the tweets sent over the Democratic presidential account dealt with a very different subject matter than those blasted about a former beauty-pageant winner by Donald Trump 24 hours before. [Trump under fire after sending nasty tweets about ex-Miss Universe] Clinton instead focused on national service, a subject to which she had devoted a speech in Florida on Friday. It's 3:20am. As good a time as any to tweet about national service, said the first one, coming at the same time that Trump started his storm of disparaging tweets about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. The next Clinton tweet borrowed a favorite word of Trump. There are hundreds of thousands more @AmeriCorps applications than spots. Horrible! it read. Let's expand it from 75,000 annual members to 250,000. The tweets several more followed were the latest bid by Clinton to keep a spotlight on what she described Friday as Trump coming unhinged. In his tweets, the Republican presidential nominee called Machado disgusting and a con and raised questions about her past, alleging she had been in a sex tape. [Clinton calls for new National Service Reserve during Florida swing] The former Miss story has dominated media coverage of the election since Clinton brought her up at debate, when she criticized Trump for denigrating comments he made in 1996 about weight. Unlike Trump, who often tweets himself, many of those sent out over official campaign account are composed by aides. On Friday, there were a series mocking behavior, and at a rally in Coral Springs, Fla., she accused her rival of having a meltdown. twitter account appeared to have been silent in the early-morning hours on Saturday.|2022-10-10 02:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|City Times|19490|48967|145|4269|Pakistan|English|2022-10-10 00:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|3344400|3351600|1821|2.4166666666666665
5236|Kentucky governor: Electing Hillary Clinton may eventually lead to violence|"Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) told religious conservatives at the Values Voters Summit this weekend that blood might have to be shed if Hillary Clinton is elected president. ""I want us to be able to fight ideologically, mentally, spiritually, economically, so that we have to do it physically, Bevin said Saturday. But that may, in fact, be the case."" He added, citing Thomas Jefferson's ""blood of patriots and tyrants"" quote: ""The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood. Of who? The tyrants, to be sure. But who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren."" Bevin, a tea party supporter who has been known to make a controversial comment or two, clarified his comments to the Lexington Herald-Leader, saying he was referring to military sacrifice. ""Today we have thousands of men and women in uniform fighting for us overseas, and they need our full backing, Bevin said in a statement. We cannot be complacent about the determination of radical Islamic extremists to destroy our freedoms."" Bevin's comments echo a tea party rallying cry that has cropped up from time to time. Activists and even some lawmakers have cited Jefferson's quote to reinforce the stakes for their political movement. As for the 2016 campaign, Bevin's comments are the latest example of elected officials promising very bad things if the wrong candidate is elected. And it's not just Democrats warning about Donald Trump having his finger on the nuclear button a prospect that has been the subject of a Hillary Clinton campaign ad. Former congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) warned recently that a Clinton win might mean this could be the ""last election"" in which Americans would be able to elect a president with ""godly moral principles."" Similarly, other Republicans have warned that nominating Trump might lead to the end of the Republican Party as we know it. George W. Bush even suggested he might be the last Republican president. Conservative talk show hosts have warned of even worse, up to and including civil war. But Bevin's comments appear to be the most full-throated warning about a Clinton presidency so far from a high-ranking GOP elected official."|2022-09-22 23:00:00|REAL|Daniel Patel|Morning Star|77213|63957|301|6191|Myanmar|English|2022-09-21 10:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|1738800|1872000|2256|5.016666666666667
5242|How Clinton's Email Controversy Is Affecting Her Campaign|"With just 59 days remaining until Election Day, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is still facing questions - and attacks - over her email controversy. Her Republican opponent Donald Trump took shots at her over the issue Thursday while speaking in Cleveland. ""Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program among many other extremely sensitive matters. This is yet more evidence that Clinton is unfit to be your commander in chief,"" the business mogul charged. Clinton has claimed that she didn't send or receive any email with classified marking, but a new report from Fox News says that a Clinton email had classified markings on virtually every paragraph. Meanwhile, Clinton talked freely about her faith to the National Baptist Convention, the oldest African-American Baptist denomination. ""Sometimes people ask me, are you a praying person? And I tell them, 'If I wasn't one before, one week living in the White House or on the campaign trail would've turned me into a praying person,"" she said in Kansas City, Missouri, Thursday, Clinton's lead over Trump has been dropping in the polls in recent days. But the race will, as always, come down to the Electoral College, especially in the swing states -- and the polls show the race getting tighter in four of the key states. In a new Quinnipiac poll that also includes the two independent candidates, Trump has a slight lead in Ohio, but is tied with Clinton in Florida. The former secretary of state, however, holds slim leads in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. While Clinton still appears to be ahead in the Electoral College, the campaign is far from over. Both candidates are likely to focus the last two months of the campaign on the battleground states, where the race will almost certainly be decided."|2022-09-10 22:00:00|REAL|Victoria Singh|The Daily Dispatch|787245|88712|239|7403|Vietnam|English|2022-09-06 21:00:00|Crónica|1|True|482400|831600|1797|3.9833333333333334

Ernst was speaking at the ""Roast & Ride"" event in Des Moines, Iowa, that she hosted. Trump later addressed the audience; he did not address Ernst's remarks. ""Hillary Clinton has given us so much to talk about really in the email scandal and her policies overseas. Really, she has a record of failure. Let's talk about that record of failure. We can focus on issues, not name-calling,"" Ernst said. ""I don't like it when campaigns go that direction. I'd say to both of them, back down. And let's really talk about the policies and the issues. That's my advice to them,"" Ernst was quoted in The Post. Ernst's comments come after Trump was criticized for calling Clinton a ""bigot"" at a campaign rally, and repeatedly refused to back down from the claims. ""That is not acceptable to be doing the name-calling back and forth,"" Ernst said. ""We need to focus on the issues. He has given voice to millions of American and there's something there. Americans feel that their voice is not being heard and he has really given her a platform, let's focus on the failures of Hillary Clinton,"" Ernst told CNN."|2022-09-17 09:00:00|REAL|Lily Wang|Metro News|25694|25480|465|4580|Ukraine|English|2022-09-09 11:00:00|Crónica|1|True|1389600|705600|1184|7.75
5249|Paul Manafort resigns as Trump campaign chairman after Breitbart shake-up|After a week of horrible headlines, Paul Manafort abruptly resigned as chairman of Donald presidential campaign this morning. So much for a Friday news dump. second campaign chief had already been effectively booted from his top role after Trump decided to bring in Breitbart News boss Stephen Bannon as his new campaign CEO and Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager over the weekend. The trouble for Manafort, who replaced first Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski earlier this summer, really began in earnest with attacks on a Muslim American Gold Star family. Manafort, a longtime Republican player who has spent the last couple of decades lobbying on behalf of foreign dictators, was brought on by the campaign to deal with a possible contested convention. But the less than star-studded affair featured the prominent non-endorsement from former rival Ted Cruz and was bested by a Democratic convention that set-off a days long attack on the Khan family. Hardly a good look for Trump, by nearly all accounts. days reportedly grew numbered as Trump became enraged that his campaign was unable to mobilize Republican support over his attack on the Khans. As reports of connections to the Kremlin through his work with the pro-Russian Ukrainian government of Victor Yanukovych grew more troublesome, Trump moved to undercut the veteran political operative. In one week, there were reports that Manafort was listed on a secret ledger as having received $12.7 million in under-the-table payments, that he played a key role in fomenting pro-annexation sentiments in Crimea ahead of the Russian invasion, and that he illegally funneled foreign cash towards pro-Putin lobbying efforts in the U.S. Trump thanked Manafort for the contributions he made during his three months leading the campaign in a statement Friday. I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success, Trump said. MANAFORT RESIGNS, per two sources briefed.

5258|Clinton doubles down on disputed claim FBI found her email remarks 'truthful'|"Hillary Clinton has doubled down on her assertion that the FBI declared her public remarks on her email scandal consistent and truthful, despite independent fact-checkers concluding otherwise. And as the FBI said, everything that said publicly has been consistent and truthful with what told [the FBI], Clinton said Wednesday in an interview with Brandon Rittiman of KUSA News. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler swiftly chided the Democratic presidential candidate for repeating the ""roundly debunked"" claim. Clinton first cited the FBI in her defense last Sunday when Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace noted Director James Comey had contradicted her claim she never sent classified material from her home server. That's not what I heard Director Comey say Director Comey said that my answers were truthful and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails, she said. Several fact-checkers, however, called her out on that claim. The Washington Post's Kessler awarded her four Pinnochios, and noted, Comey has repeatedly not taken a stand on her public statements. PolitiFact gave her a Pants on Fire rating for a lack of truthfulness and FactCheck.org declared her claims false. Comey did tell Congress: We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI. But he did not say the same about her public statements. During testimony before a House committee, Comey said it was not true that nothing Clinton sent or received was marked classified. To the contrary, he said, there was classified material emailed. Donald Trump also doubled down Thursday on his claim he saw video of Iranians taking $400 million in cash off an airplane on the same day American hostages were released. His campaign earlier said he meant that he saw television coverage of the hostages, not the cash, leaving an airplane. Afterward, Trump once again clarified, this time via Twitter."|2022-09-28 02:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Capital Gazette|69709|76731|381|7395|Mexico|English|2022-09-14 21:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|1173600|2314800|1988|6.35
526|Obama to propose spending $74B more in 2016 than mandatory spending cuts|"President Obama on Thursday will seek to rally Democrats behind a budget proposal he'll release next week that would spend $74 billion more in discretionary investments than would be allowed under the spending caps mandated by Congress four years ago in an attempt to reduce the federal deficit, according to White House officials. The proposal, a 7 percent increase over sequestration levels, includes $530 billion on the non-defense discretionary side, an increase of $37 billion over the spending caps; and $561 billion in defense spending, an increase of $38 billion over the spending caps. The plan prompted an immediate outcry from Republicans. ""He is the most liberal, fiscally irresponsible president we've had in history,"" said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in an interview. ""I don't know why he doesn't see it."" Obama will preview his plans in remarks to House Democrats at their retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday. The president's budget proposal ""will fully reverse those cuts for domestic priorities, and match those investments dollar-for-dollar with the resources our troops need to keep America safe,"" said the administration official, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Congress established the sequester through the Budget Control Act in 2011, mandating spending cuts that were projected to total $1.2 trillion and were scheduled to begin in 2013 and end in 2021, evenly divided over the nine-year period. Obama's push to exceed the spending caps is already sparking a fight with Republicans, who have criticized him for attempting to grow the government at a time when wages have stagnated, limiting the benefits of the economic recovery. Republicans believe there are smarter ways to cut spending than the sequester and have passed legislation to replace it multiple times, only to see the president continue to demand tax hikes,"" said Cory Fritz, spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner. ""Until he gets serious about solving our long-term spending problem, hard to take him seriously."" In his address to fellow Democrats, Obama also plans to emphasize the need for Congress to pass a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security beyond Feb. 27, when the agency's funds are set to expire. House Republicans are attempting to use that deadline to force Obama to accept a rollback of his executive actions on immigration announced in November."|2022-09-22 22:00:00|REAL|Isabella Nguyen|Metro News|805637|67466|399|2477|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-02 06:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|82800|1868400|2410|6.65

Ernst told Fox News they had a ""good conversation,"" adding, ""I will continue to share my insights with Donald about the need to strengthen our economy, keep our nation safe, and ensure America is always a strong, stabilizing force around the globe."" Earlier, Trump tweeted, ""I look forward to meeting (Ernst) today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!"" Over the weekend, Trump met with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and his wife, though a Pence spokesman said ""nothing was offered."" The spokesman, Marc Lotter, added, ""The governor had warm, productive meetings with the Trumps."" He declined to say where the Saturday meeting was held. Pence is running for re-election against Democratic former state House Speaker John Gregg. Trump and Pence discussed Pence's policies during his term as governor which began in 2013, Lotter said. He also declined to discuss Pence's level of interest in the position, echoing a comment from Pence last week that he did not want to talk about ""a hypothetical."" Trump tweeted Monday about his Saturday meeting with Pence. ""Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people! Trump tweeted. As Pence and his wife arrived for a concert Sunday night at Conner Prairie, a history park in Fishers, the governor again declined to discuss whether he was interested in the position. He reiterated his support for Trump's candidacy and said the Trumps ""couldn't have been more kind and gracious"" during the meeting. Trump has never held public office and is considering a small group of political veterans as potential running mates. People with direct knowledge of Trump's vetting process say the list includes Pence, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. In addition to serving as governor, Pence served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 12 years. He also at one time had his own presidential ambitions but last year ruled out a run after his popularity fell in the wake of criticism over his handling of the state's religious objections law.

After vote, hundreds of thousands of California schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en español, thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in English. Proposition 58 would repeal Proposition 227, a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago, in 1998. Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach overwhelmingly in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. When passed, Proposition 227 overthrew the previous norm of bilingual education. But now, with immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. Polls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for dual immersion programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage. Dual immersion is legal already, it just requires consent. What these disputes are about is which is the default: English or Spanish? Supporters also claim that returning to bilingual education will improve English acquisition; favorable ads emphasize that Proposition 58 will ensure that all students learn English. But the primary thrust of the proposition is clear: Students from non-English homes will find it far easier to have their children be primarily taught in their native tongue, while spending far less time learning English."|2022-10-07 09:00:00|FAKE|Amelia Rivera|The Pulse|931065|65244|27|4460|Nigeria|English|2022-09-21 20:00:00|Noticia internacional|1|True|3117600|1774800|1966|0.45

5307|Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People I’ve Insulted Deserved It|Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People Insulted Deserved It By Andrew Bradford on October 27, 2016 Subscribe Arrogance is defined as an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people. In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. Appearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts made on Twitter: ok, most of them deserved it. Trump then declared : I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it come out you have to be careful with it. When exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. Melania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well. Does that mean take away cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! Earlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015. If you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the Times article and recall what Hillary Clinton said regarding the Donald: A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Donald Trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world.

5313|New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain|New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain 11/03/2016 RUSSIA TODAY Scientists may have made a significant breakthrough in restoring human sight, as a woman who had been blind for seven years has regained the ability to see shapes and colours with a bionic eye implant. The 30-year-old woman had a wireless visual stimulator chip inserted into her brain by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) surgeons in the first human test of the product. As a result, she could see colored flashes, lines, and spots when signals were sent to her brain from a computer. The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, suffered no significant adverse side effects in the process, according to a statement. The device, which was developed as part of the Orion 1 programme by Second Sight, uses technology to restore sight by bypassing the optic nerve to stimulate the visual cortex, according to chairman Robert Greenberg. It is designed for those who cannot benefit from the Argus II retinal system that was unveiled at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last year, but has limited application, as it depends on the patient having some retinal cells. This new system goes one step further by sending signals directly to the brain. It has the potential to restore sight to those who have gone completely blind for virtually any reason, including glaucoma, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, or trauma, according to the manufacturer. The next step is to connect the implant to a camera on a pair of glasses, and the company plans to seek FDA approval in 2017 to get the go ahead to conduct these trials. UCLA neurosurgeon Nader Pouratian, who implanted the stimulator, said the results of the surgery are promising. Based on these results, stimulation of the visual cortex has the potential to restore useful vision to the blind, which is important for independence and improving quality of life, he said.|2022-09-23 18:00:00|FAKE|Amelia Rivera|The Pulse|411185|85328|509|4626|Algeria|English|2022-09-09 00:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|1940400|666000|1888|8.483333333333333

5317|Leftist Hypocrisy On “Peace, Love, And Equality” BRUTALLY Exposed|Pinterest Robert Gehl reports that of all the videos and images to come out of the Milwaukee riots, one that is particularly chilling. The 2-minute video is apparently taken during the riots Saturday night following the shooting of a black, armed man who was reportedly a gang member. Moments after the shooting occurred, hundreds of rioters took to the streets, setting cars on fire and burning about a half-dozen businesses. Chants of Black Power! could be heard sporadically as well. But in this video, it appears an entire gang of black youth are seeking out and targeting white people to assault. Hey! beating up every white person! Get every white person! the cameraman says. When he witnesses someone being assaulted, he asks Who they up? Who they up? At one point, when they spot a white person, he screams He white! Beat his shit! Beat! The thug pans around looking for white people to assault. You can hear the crowd reacting, trying to point out white people. Again, he cries: Hey! They beating up every white person! Apparently he spots a homeless man. Look at the white bum! Look at the white bum! Throughout the rest of the video, screams of white people as their racist hunt continues. Toward the end, shots ring out in the distance, startling the cameraman. Who the f*** is shooting? Stop shooting! Moments later, shots are fired much closer and the video ends. This is the direct result of the Black Lives Matter racist, anti-police agenda and Barack acceptance of their cause. This is post-racial America .

In the video, prominent Ross donor Benjamin Barber expresses his opinion about blacks who vote Republican by comparing them to Nazis. Have you heard of the Sonderkommandos ?

A homeless man sleeps on the steps of St. Church, Tuesday, June 23, 2015 in New York. The San Antonio Police Department known for its strict measures against homeless people announced that it had fired a five-year veteran police officer after he attempted to feed a homeless man a fecal sandwich in May. According to the statement, police officer Matthew Luckhurst bragged to a fellow officer about trying to feed the man human feces before his unnamed colleague reported the incident to the internal affairs in July. This was a vile and disgusting act that violates our guiding principles of all with integrity, compassion, fairness and Chief William McManus said in a statement Friday. The fact that his fellow officers were so disgusted with his actions that they reported him to Internal Affairs demonstrates that this type of behavior will never be tolerated. In 2014, however, McManus wanted to make giving money to homeless people a crime but the idea was shelved after public outcry. The decision to fire Luckhurst was based on recommendations by two separate review boards which were upheld by McManus. The Associated Press reported that at least two officers reported the incidents to internal affairs. However, lawyer told the San Antonio Express-News, which first reported the story, that his client would appeal the decision and denied that the incident had taken place ever and his comments were a joke. According to the local San Antonio Current, the police issued more than 12,000 citations in 22 months between 2013 and 2014 related to violations of city laws aimed at discouraging the homeless and poor from hanging out downtown or asking for donations. The newspaper said homeless people were charged with aggressive solicitation seeking donations in an intimidating manner solicitation within forbidden zones, camping in a public place, littering, spitting, urinating or defecating in public, disorderly conduct and sitting or lying in manners obstructing the right of way. According to Haven For Hope, there are almost 3,000 homeless people in the city, of whom 42 percent have no shelter and sleep in the streets.|2022-09-26 12:00:00|FAKE|Avery Kim|The Observer|953425|81161|321|7074|Japan|English|2022-09-17 09:00:00|Carta al editor|0|True|2178000|1389600|2321|5.35

The more I think about how dejected and overcome I feel, the more I begin to see myself and my viewpoints in Hillary Clinton. In fact, I know the last time related to a candidate this much. Many Americans went on to confirm that their perception of Hillary Clinton being completely out of touch with the majority of the country has now made the former secretary of state far more likable.

The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and have a voice, says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. had legal immigrants had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say. Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the broken immigration system in this country. {snip} Today there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let noncitizens vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where noncitizens make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed noncitizens to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New school boards were dissolved in 2002. {snip}|2022-09-07 00:00:00|FAKE|Chloe Nguyen|Press Pulse|581464|18112|22|3510|Egypt|English|2022-09-05 19:00:00|Artículo de opinión|1|True|388800|493200|1828|0.36666666666666664

5383|Ron Paul to Trump: Don't Listen to Neocons!|Written by Adam Dick Friday November 11, 2016 Ron Paul, known for his promotion of the United States following a noninterventionist foreign policy, presented Thursday his take on the prospects of Donald foreign policy as president. Paul set out his analysis in an extensive interview with host Peter Lavelle at RT. Paul started off the interview saying that he is keeping his fingers crossed regarding potential foreign policy actions. Paul says he views favorably comments in the presidential election about being less confrontational with Russia and criticizing some of the US wars in the Middle East. Paul, though, notes that Trump has presented vague foreign policy positions overall. Paul also comments that a good indication of how Trump will act on foreign policy issues will be provided by looking at who Trump appoints to positions in the executive branch and from whom Trump receives advice. Regarding foreign policy advisors and potential appointees, Paul expresses in the interview reason for concern. Paul states: Unfortunately, there have been several neoconservatives that are getting closer to Trump, and, if he gets his advice from them, then I think that is a good sign. Even if Trump wants to pursue a significantly more noninterventionist course than his recent predecessors in the presidency, Paul warns that the entrenched deep state that favors foreign intervention and war, special interests that have sinister motivation for these wars, and media propaganda that builds up the war fever can provide significant headwinds against Trump pursuing such an objective.

5385|When Nobody Returns: Palestinians Show They are People, Too|Email I was in London last weekend to view a play, Nobody . The play, written by British writer Brian Woolland and jointly produced by Border Crossings , Ramallah-based Ashtar Theatre and Central School of Speech and Drama , tells the Greek myth known to many of A mixed cast of Palestinian and British actors delivered a riveting performance of poise and emotion. The classic text rings clear, intermingled with language we all hear every day and sets that those who know the story of the Palestinians and other downtrodden people will recognise. The inspired use of a variety of sets at differing levels and positions in the theatre in Acklam Village brings the audience right in to the heart of the drama and to the edge of their seats. The analogues nature of the occupation of Ithaka, at the heart of the play, to the story of Palestinians is clear throughout the play yet not overwrought. I have been a supporter of the Palestinian cause since I became politically aware in my mid-teens. This political awakening took place during the post 9-11 atmosphere in the west. As US troops draped the star spangled banner upon and tore down statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad, the Second Intifada raged across the Palestinian territories and Israel. As Bob Dylan once sung, we live in a political world. As I have learnt more about the history and present occupation of Palestinian land, I have always felt that the drive to free the Palestinians of their daily humiliation at the hands of the Israeli state should be led by Palestinians. Productions such as Nobody provide agency to Palestinians, those Palestinians who still grind out an existence on the West Bank and Gaza and those in exile, to tell their fundamental story of loss, betrayal, despair and ultimately strength. You can see and feel this strength in the performances of the actors. Iman Aoun, who plays Penelope wife, exudes the granite and dignified exterior of a war widow who refuses to be beaten by the occupier. If you are a supporter of Palestinian human rights and enjoy theatre of the highest quality I encourage you to plan a visit to see Nobody and the prequel Flesh is (drawn from The Iliad).|2022-10-03 14:00:00|FAKE|Owen Rodriguez|City Times|911237|81358|44|8832|Uganda|English|2022-09-04 20:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2790000|306000|2169|0.7333333333333333
5389|Russian FM Lavrov reminds USA of war crimes in Yugoslavia|"Russian FM Lavrov reminds USA of war crimes in Yugoslavia 31.10.2016 | Source: Pravda.Ru Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reminded the United States of its bombings of Belgrade, Yugoslavia , when the US did not seem to care at all for civilian casualties. Today, the US tries to accuse Russia of war crimes in Syria , Lavrov said in an interview for Rossiya 1 TV channel for a documentary about Russian politician Yevgeny Primakov. ""When a true patriot, an experienced politician, an outstanding statesman, a man with great intuition, with an encyclopedic education - when he learned about the bombings of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the United States, he did not see any possibility to continue ""business as usual"" with the USA. His plane made a U-turn in midair, and that U-turn meant that Russia could not but defend its truth in cooperation with other powers to achieve equal relations and mutually advantageous arrangements - this is the purpose that Russia has,"" Sergei Lavrov said. ""The aggression against Yugoslavia was, of course, an act of aggression, and it was also the first armed attack on a sovereign state in Europe since 1945. If we talk about it now against the background of what is happening around Syria, our Western partners, especially American and British ones, have already reached the level of public threats in their hysteria, using words such as ""barbaric,"" ""war crimes,"" said Sergey Lavrov.""The aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was fraught with attacks on a huge number of civilian targets, including, among other things, television of Serbia, bridges, on which civilian passenger trains were traveling and a lot more. Thousands were killed, including several hundreds of children, a quarter of a million of refugees, whom no one has ever thought of since then. If Russia, in Primakov's face, would not have reacted the way that he had reacted to such a blatant violation of international law, we wouldn't have probably forgiven that to ourselves for a long time, and our history would have had another very unpleasant page,"" the Russian Foreign Minister said.

5396|BREAKING: AP Finds Proof Melania Trump Illegally Worked In U.S. PRIOR To Getting Work Visa|In what may be the last bombshell to drop prior to Election Day, the Associated Press is now reporting that they have found the smoking gun that proves Melania Trump worked illegally in the United States prior to obtaining a work visa. This means: For all intents and purposes, Melania was the sort of illegal immigrant that her husband now labels as criminals and morally-bankrupt. The Trump family lied about this fact and conspired to cover it up for the duration of the election. This comes at a supremely bad time for Trump, who recently made Melania a campaign centerpiece including a much publicized speech you guessed immigration. what the AP found : The documents obtained by the AP show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, during a time when her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work but not perform paid work in the country. The documents examined by the AP indicate that the modeling assignments would have been outside the bounds of her visa. It is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But the government effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes. According to the documents, Melania made roughly $20,000 illegally before getting her visa only slightly less money in seven weeks than the average undocumented worker Trump disparages as moochers make in a year . While existing standards mean Melania would likely remain a U.S. citizen despite her previous violations, her plans to crack down on illegal immigration might be working against her. Trump has long held that people who cheated to get into the United States illegally should be moved to the back of the line. Would he include his wife in that sweeping category? Of course, Melania Trump should not be deported over a technicality in her early immigration status. However, her husband might want to think about that fact when he screams at rallies about rounding up families of Hispanic immigrants and shipping them out of the country. Melania is living proof that the immigration issue in this country exactly cut-and-dry. Not that Trump is known for any semblance of nuance.

5397|US Officials Try to Scare Voters With Terror Threat|US Intelligence Sees Attacks Likely Ahead of Tuesday Vote by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This US intelligence officials have reportedly warned law enforcement around the country of the potential for multiple al-Qaeda terrorist attacks on Monday, aimed to coincide with the day before the US election. The reports were described as possibly legitimate and concerning. Details are still scant, but the intelligence has singled out New York, Virginia, and Texas as the mostly likely targets. Even then, they offered no details on potential locations, saying al-Qaeda and its affiliates are eager to regain their relevance. A NYPD spokesman briefed on the matter said that the threats lack specificity , however local police around the country were said to have been warned that polling places are considered attractive targets for both organized and homegrown terror attacks. Of course, saying that any upcoming event is a potential attractive target is not unusual these days, and hardly a significant holiday goes by in the US where warnings and briefings about potential attacks are not heavily publicized. The Monday warning offers some unusual details, however, as generally one would think the day of the election itself would be the target, when more people are queuing up for the vote. An attack the day before the election would, however, cast a rather dramatic pall over the entire matter.

If a Republican candidate, it would be malpractice not to talk about it, highlight it or advertise on it. To be sure, Trump has been hitting the issue hard over the past several days, mentioning the rate hikes at four separate rally appearances in a 24-hour period this week. Repealing Obamacare and stopping healthcare takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on Nov. 8, Trump told rally-goers Tuesday afternoon in Sanford, Florida. Advertisement - story continues below Other Republicans have been quick to jump on the issue as well, including vulnerable incumbent GOP senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Roy Blunt of Missouri. Should these Republican senators and others maintain a focus on Obamacare during the final two weeks, they stand a good chance of fending off the Democrat effort to wrench control of the Senate away from the GOP. The same applies to Trump, should he refrain from media distractions and continue harping on the failures of Obama and his health care law, particularly in hard-hit swing states like Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to name just a few. And he will have Obama to thank personally for paving the way to a Trump presidency through his horribly flawed Obamacare law.

The reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly, Alisyn, is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal, which is what they said they wanted to do, and replace. Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down. Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent, according to data released this week by the Obama administration. Indiana will see its rates slightly go down, but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent. Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans. 8:17|2022-10-09 07:00:00|FAKE|Ethan Hayes|Newsflash|513972|54257|56|1058|Bangladesh|English|2022-10-01 09:00:00|Entrevista|1|True|3283200|2599200|1198|0.9333333333333333

His studies in history and background in the media industry have given him a keen insight into the use of mass media as a creator of conflict in the modern world. His favored areas of study include state sponsored terrorism, media manufactured reality and the role of intelligence services in manipulation of populations and the perception of events. Trump and all the other far right leaders are Zionist stooges By Ian Greenhalgh on October 27, 2016 Naming Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France, the UN accused them of employing ""fear"" tactics similar to those of the Islamic State group. note: U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Al Hussein has really hit the nail on the head here. Not only has he correctly pointed out that Trump, Nigel Farage, Marine LePen, Geert Wilders and the rest of the far-right leaders employ the tactics of fear and bigotry but he also correctly identifies their agenda as being the promotion of hatred with the eventual result that will ensue. However, he does not go far enough in exposing these scumbags, most likely because he knows he would be placing himself in the crosshairs of the Zionists who stand behind these puppets. What went unsaid is that all of these people are stooges for the Zionists and Israel, they are tasked with creating horrible divisions in our societies, turning white against brown and black, Christian against Muslim, indigenous against migrant. This is the Zionist agenda to weaken and enslave via the strategy of divide and conquer, as laid out in the Protocols of Zion. They want to destroy our nations by promoting inter-racial hatred and violence; they want to see the nation states of the west burn down in a wave of racially motivated violence; that is why Trump spouts such hateful and disgusting rhetoric against Mexicans, blacks and Muslims, it is to promote a race war that would devastate America.

5452|Chinese Immigrants Demand Protection from Paris Muggers|Chinese Immigrants Demand Protection from Paris Muggers David Chazan, Telegraph, August 21, 2016 Thousands of angry Chinese immigrants demonstrated in a Paris suburb yesterday (Sun) to demand police protection from muggers who they say prey on them because they are seen as easy targets. The death of a 49-year-old Chinese tailor after being badly beaten in a robbery earlier this month has lent new urgency to the long running complaint that Asian immigrants are systematically attacked and robbed in the French capital. The Chinese community is dying in silence, read a slogan on a T-shirt splashed with red to symbolise bloodstains worn by one demonstrator, Maike Song. He said he joined the protest in Aubervilliers to pay homage to Chaoling Zhang, the father of two who died on August 14 after being punched to ground in the north-eastern suburb that is home to some 4,000 Chinese immigrants. No arrests have been made over the attack. About 100 Chinese residents of Aubervilliers have been attacked and robbed since November, according to the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association. It is because of prejudices that Chinese people are weak, docile and wealthy, said Fang, a young female student. been attacked three times in three years and my friends are suffering the same thing. Some have moved away from this area because of it. I go out with a handbag any more. Community workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area, generally of Arab or African origin. Paris officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin. Many Chinese immigrants own restaurants or shops and tend to be relatively well-off, but are often reluctant to go to the police. Some victims have been illegal immigrants, said Dominique Darden, a social worker. The Chinese community of Paris has held other protests in recent years over the attacks. They happen almost every day because of poverty but unbearable, said a spokesman, Olivier Wang.

5453|Russia Tests Stealth Hypersonic Nuke Capable of Wiping Texas or France|Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems. According to previous reports this nuke is also going to be made STEALTH and impossible to be detected by any current radar systems and it will carry a payload capable of wiping off areas as big as France or Texas state with a single missile. The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Far East. The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field, the Defense Ministry reported. Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology. Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload. A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.

5464|Hillary Clinton Hits Unfavorability High of 60%, Higher Than Trump|"Hillary Clinton Hits Unfavorability High of 60%, Higher Than Trump October 31, Remember last week when Hillary Clinton was shopping around for White House drapes and the ""popular"" wisdom was that she was inevitable? That was fun. Wasn't it. Now she hit an unfavorability rating high of 60 percent. That's higher than Trump. It also means that the candidate who claims she's going to bring Americans together is disliked by most of the country . Clinton is seen unfavorably by 60 percent of likely voters in the latest results, a new high. Trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many -- 58 percent. Marking the depth of these views, 49 percent see Clinton ""strongly"" unfavorably, and 48 percent say the same about Trump unusual levels of strong sentiment. The extent of partisan antipathy in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, is remarkable: Ninety-seven percent of Trump supporters see Clinton unfavorably; 90 percent, strongly so. Ninety-five percent of Clinton supporters see Trump unfavorably again, 90 percent strongly so. But remember Hillary is ""inevitable"". Now the Clinton campaign has decided to go after the FBI under the assumption that people like Hillary more than the FBI. That may be a slight misjudgment. And by slight, I mean huge.

5476|Robin Roberts Says While She Was Dying from Cancer a ‘Familiar Voice’ Came From Her Nurse and Brought Her Back|Share on Twitter For Robin Roberts, losing her mother while she was in the midst of her own fight for her life was an especially hard blow. Roberts's mother had always been there for her through every illness and injury. When she needed her mom the most, however, Roberts swears that she could hear her voice, encouraging her not to give up on life. Image Credit: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images As PopSugar reports, on a recent episode of Harry , the Good Morning America co-host tearfully recounted the days she spent in the hospital after a bone marrow transplant. Famously open about her battles with breast cancer and a rare bone marrow disease, Roberts tells host Harry Connick Jr. that she had reached the point where the fight was too much for her: There was a time when I sent everybody away, and I was in my room, and I just felt like I'm slipping away. I just couldn't. One of the things that had made Roberts feel like giving up was the fact that her mother was no longer there by her side. However, she was soon to find that her mom was closer than she realized. She tells Harry: I kept hearing this voice, 'Robin! Robin! Robin!' And suddenly, I open my eyes, and it's ... my nurse Jenny. She's looking at me. That was my mother's voice. I am convinced, when I was hearing that, even though it was Jenny, it was my mother's voice I was hearing. Roberts believes that at her point of greatest isolation , her mother used Jenny to call her back, to remind her to keep fighting. Jenny, Roberts says, was invaluable during this time. Acknowledging the bond between Roberts and her nurse, Harry surprised Roberts by reuniting her with nurse Jenny and another nurse who had cared for her. An emotional Roberts was able to thank them for not only everything they had done for her, but for what they have done for countless others: Thank you for being our lifeline. Thank you for being not only for us, but for our caregivers ... for our loved ones.|2022-10-07 16:00:00|FAKE|Grace Liu|The Observer|91840|81267|44|950|Vietnam|English|2022-09-06 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|3142800|482400|1950|0.7333333333333333

5500|Here’s What Happens in Your Brain When You Lie|posted by Eddie A new study revealed that consistent small lies could alter the way on how a certain part of the brain associated to negative emotions respond to lie, desensitizing our brain in the process and encourages bigger lies in the future. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , is the first to provide empirical evidence that telling small lies could gradually lead to larger lies. Additionally, the study is also the first to have a deeper look on the responses to repeated and increasing acts of dishonesty. When we lie for personal gain, our amygdala produces a negative feeling that limits the extent to which we are prepared to lie, explained senior author Dr Tali Sharot, from University College London Experimental Psychology, in a statement . However, this response fades as we continue to lie, and the more it falls the bigger our lies become. This may lead to a where small acts of dishonesty escalate into more significant lies. For the study, the researchers recruited 80 volunteers. The participants took part in a team estimation task that involved guessing the number of pennies in the jar and sending their estimates to unseen partners using computers. The researchers introduced the participants in different scenarios that may affect their estimation. As the baseline scenario, the participants were told that aiming for the most accurate estimate would benefit them and their partners. Other scenarios include over- or under-estimating the amount of pennies would either benefit them both, benefit them at their expense, benefit their partners at their expense and benefit one of them without any effect on the other one. The researchers observed that participants started exaggerating their estimates in the scenario in which over-estimating would benefit them at the expense of their partner. The exaggeration of the estimates elicited a strong response from the amygdala. However, as the Due exaggerations of the estimate continue to escalate throughout the study, the response from the amygdala declined. These findings show that the amygdala signals aversion to acts that considered to wrong or immoral. However, repeated acts of dishonesty can solicit a blunt response from the brain, reducing the emotional response to dishonest acts.

Later, Arts Against Aggression group in Boston organized a Halloween-style installation called ""Putin & Matsuev House of Horror s"" near the building of a local concert hall. According to the organizers of the above-mentioned acts, US citizens should ask themselves whether it is appropriate to continue cooperation with the Russian artists, who support the policies of President Vladimir Putin.Denis Matsuev runs many charitable programs, conducts youth music competitions and festivals for youth and children, such as ""Stars on Baikal"" and ""Crescendo.""In December 2011, Matsuev became an honorary professor at the Moscow State University. He headed the Interregional Charitable Foundation ""New Names,"" the purpose of which is to provide education to talented children.Denis Matsuev is also the art director of the Foundation named after Sergei Rachmaninoff. Matsuev appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a request to buy back Rachmaninoff's Swiss estate ""Senart"" to establish the International Cultural Centre at the property. In February 2006, the pianist became a member of the Council for Culture and Arts under the Russian President.Noteworthy, it is not the first time, when Russian musicians face such obstruction due to the political situation in the world. After the concert of the Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre in Palmyra, some pundits found the performance ""rather weak"". Thus, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called the concert in Palmyra a tasteless and cynical idea.In general, however, the majority of Western officials supported the cultural campaign of the prominent and world-famous Moscow orchestra.

5528|The Reopening Of The Clinton Email Investigation Is More GOP Hype Over Nothing|"The letter from FBI Director Comey announcing the reopening of the Clinton email investigation is already being blown up into more than it is. Here is the letter via Jake Tapper: FBI Dir Comey letter to congressional committee chairs re discovery of ""new to the investigation""  Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 28, 2016 As Republicans cheer because they think that they have been thrown an election lifeline, read the whole letter and look at what it says. The letter does not say that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. The letter states that emails were found that were pertinent to the email investigation while looking into an unrelated matter. The letter FBI Director Comey reads like what it is, an update on an investigation. The FBI is dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. letter destroys the Republican claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up emails. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have spent months criticizing investigation, but it turns out that they were wrong. It would take something unprecedented and dramatic to change the original findings. Director Comey made it clear that the work might not be completed before the election. The email story that Republicans and the media love, but voters have never cared about is back in the news, but it remains an empty scandal. The reopened investigation does open the door for Republicans to continue their bogus witch hunt if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. Unless voters want two more years of conspiracy investigations instead of action, developments have made voting for Democrats in House and Senate contests more vital than ever."|2022-10-03 11:00:00|FAKE|William Kumar|The Insight|346813|65795|418|4822|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-23 23:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|2779200|1958400|1614|6.966666666666667

5542|Russia stops shipping Soyuz space rockets to France|"Russia stops shipping Soyuz space rockets to France 28.10.2016 | Source: AP photo French newspaper Les Echos reported that Russia's state-run corporation Roscosmos will would not deliver Soyuz rockets to Arianespace of France. First off, Russia demands the receipt of the funds blocked in connection with the Yukos case. A statement from Roscosmos says that the Russian company will not work for free. ""No money - no products,"" Les Echos quoted a message from the corporation. It goes about 300 million euros, which Arianespace was supposed to pay to Roscosmos, but the funds were frozen by the Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the case of former Yukos shareholders . Previously, Roscosmos had won a case in France about the arrest of accounts of the state corporation in the Yukos case. ""They acknowledged that our arguments were correct, but we will continue defending our interests,"" director of communications at Roscosmos, Igor Burenkov said. On April 11, France arrested $700 million of Roskosmos and Space Communications money in connection with a judicial decision on the case of Yukos. Interestingly, NASA plans to purchase seats for its astronauts on board the Soyuz spaceship as Boeing and SpaceX seem to be unable to prepare their spaceships on time. US-based commercial companies Boeing and SpaceX are developing their own manned spacecraft - Starliner and Dragon. The deadline is near, so Houston has decided to consider a possibility to buy extra seats on board Russia's Soyuz. NASA hopes that at least one of the private spaceships will be able to perform operational tasks by the end of 2017 or early 2018. For the time being, one of the six necessary seats on the Soyuz spaceship costs the US nearly $82 million. By 2019, the price will increase.

As such, avoided writing about it, hoping that someone from the Clinton team would come out and put all the craziness to rest. That has not happened. Indeed, the topic was trending at #1 for much of the morning on Twitter, and continues to trend at #3 many hours later. All day, been trying as hard as possible to disassociate my confirmation bias about the Clintons, from this story. As such, been waiting for a good debunking piece to come out, but have yet to see one. For those of you who are interested in the topic, a measured take from The Washington Times : A new WikiLeaks release of stolen emails belonging to Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta reveal an invitation by his brother to a Spirit Cooking dinner at the home of artist Marina Abramovic. Spirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipes was released by Ms. Abramovic in 1996, but the ingredients call for fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk to be consumed on earthquake nights. New Museum of Modern Art called it a cookbook for evocative instructions for actions or thoughts. Another recipe calls for fresh morning urine. Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner Mary? Tony Podesta says in an email forwarded to his brother June 28, 2015. Dear Tony, I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place, Ms. Abramovic says in a June 25 email sent at 2:35 a.m. GMT +2. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.

As per the latest data, Facebook has approximately 71 million active Indian users out of which 15 million are anonymous/fake while Twitter has 22 million active Indian users out of which 7 million are anonymous/fake, posing a big threat to the idea of troll-less (white) social media. Announcing this historic move, the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter issued a joint statement: All anonymous / fake accounts with more than 500 friends / 1000 followers will be suspended at 12 midnight of 9th November. These friends/ followers along with content can be transferred to the original account till 31st December 2016. Here are some of the highlights of the historic speech: 1. No content can be posted / tweeted / shared / re-tweeted from the anonymous/fake account after 12 am of 9th Nov. 2. The content of the anonymous account can be transferred by submitting an original DP/ original name. The last date for the same is 31st Dec. 3. In case of an emergency post (like trolling a politician / cricketer / film celebrity), user can login using his original login details and post for the next 72 hours. 4. All users with less than 100 followers will continue to exist and be spared from suspension. 5.

I am appalled that National Guard officials are attempting to recoup money from soldiers who accepted bonuses a decade ago, the Democratic nominee said in a statement released Monday night in response to the reports, which first appeared in the Los Angeles Times. These troops deserve our support and our deepest gratitude; they served admirably and upheld their part of the bargain, she said. It is unacceptable to now subject them and their families to undue financial burdens thanks to to mismanagement from the California National Guard and rigid bureaucracy on the part of the Pentagon.

As the troops near Mosul, however, Pentagon spokesman Col. John Dorrian insists there are no plans so far for troops to enter Mosul. Col. Dorrian insisted that government has said just gonna be their forces. He did, however, say he want to say US troops would never be involved, insisting that the plans could change at any time. Other officials, quoted anonymously by Reuters , suggested that the definition of Mosul could also change, saying that suburbs and parts of the outskirts could easily be redefined as not Mosul, allowing US troops to enter those areas without having to technically enter Mosul. The Obama Administration initially promised no boots on the ground in Iraq, but with some 6,000 such troops in Iraq, seen been trying desperately to claim they are in non-combat roles. This too has been difficult to sell, with a number of those troops embedded in combat units. Those troops are nominally advisers, but are regularly being put into combat areas.

5606|First Iraqi Troops Enter Mosul, But Fighting Remains Largely in Suburbs|Military: Goal Is to 'Liberate' Eastern Bank of Tigris River by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This invasion of Mosul has entered its third week with a noteworthy first, as the first Iraqi special forces entered the city itself in the area around Karama District, in the far east. There was fighting reported both within the district and in surrounding suburbs. Indications are that the vast majority of the fighting in the area remains in the suburbs, with only a small incursion into the city itself. Still, Iraqi military officials say their goal is to take the whole eastern bank of the Tigris River, which divides the city. The area entered is near a key industrial site within Mosul. It is unclear how well secured this area is from perspective, as laid heavy traps and tunneled in around the city in anticipation of the invasion, but indications were that a lot of these defensive measures were taken in residential areas. ISIS is believed to have several thousand fighters in Mosul, and with the US announcing they intend to kill anyone who tries to escape, they are likely to resist all the more fiercely, knowing they have any place to go after Mosul.

5609|Love Trumps Hate: GoFundMe To Rebuild Church Torched By Trump Supporter SHATTERS Fundraising Records|Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr Just one week before America decides whether or not to elect Donald Trump, one of his supporters decided to help get his message out by torching a black church and defacing its wall with the words Vote Trump. When firefighters arrived at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church Tuesday night, they found it in flames, and the Vote Trump slogan written in silver spray paint on the outside wall of the church, Mark Rigsby of Mississippi Public Broadcasting reports. Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons calls this a hate crime an attempt to frighten voters just days before the presidential election. Trump has yet to condemn the attack, or even mention it. Mississippi has been the host of many decades of violence directed at African Americans. During the Jim Crow era, acts of terror committed against black Mississippians was disturbingly common. It seems for at least one Trump supporter, the term Make American Great Again means returning to that dark time. But rather than let this disgusting display of intolerance be the story, Americans got to work. In just hours, a verified GoFundMe account was set up by concerned citizens and thousands of dollars began to pour in to help rebuild. goal was to raise $10,000. It likely be enough to repair all of the damages inside and outside of the church, but it would be a start. Instead, people gave over $150,000. And perhaps even more remarkably, the entire world appeared ready to reject the deplorable racism and bigotry that led to this act. The organizer updated the campaign by saying that people from all faiths (and none at all) and many countries have contributed: Responses have been pouring in from all over the world, and truly extraordinary. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists and many more, from all over the United States and many other countries. And according to VP of Communications and Policy Dan Pfeiffer, this campaign is perhaps the fastest growing in the history of the site. This one right here is verified and one of our fastest growing history Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) November 3, 2016 A slogan that has often been used to counter message of cynical bigotry comes to mind: Love trumps hate.

Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , a trained hypnotist and observer of facial nuances, calls it an unusual level of variability in her physical appearance. In his words, Hillary looks like an entirely different person every few days. See Chameleon Hillary Clinton is back to looking like sh*t and the return of her medical handler and Hillary teeth, tongue-hole & wrinkles On Monday, October 24, 2016, Hillary Clinton was in St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire for a rally , accompanied by Fauxcahontas Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Close-up images of her face show that morphed again, back to yellow teeth and a face crisscrossed with wrinkles. What happened to the porcelain-doll Hillary with dazzling-white teeth of the July 2016 Democratic National Convention? But this time, at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, something even stranger. Tuesday, Matt Drudge tweeted two close-up images of Hillary at the NH rally, which show something embedded under the skin of her right cheek . the tweet: Here are the two images again, enlarged. I painted yellow arrows pointing to the lumps: According to plastic surgeons , Botox injections cause lumps under the skin. Dr. Richard Baxter explains that Botox relaxes muscles that are hyperactive and so wrinkles caused by those muscles are smoothed, but lead to lumps. Dr. Janet Turkle says that although Botox injections can result in temporary bumps due to the injection, the bumps last only a few minutes. According to the American Academy of Facial Esthetics , however, some of the risks of facial injections are lumps (granulomas/nodules) which are a potential risks [sic] associated with Radiesse, Sculptra, Juvederm, and ArteColl. Facial injections are injections of facial fillers such as collagen, hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyl apatite that rejuvenate facial skin by reducing or eliminating wrinkles, raising scar depressions, enhancing lips and replacing soft-tissue volume loss.

5612|Life: When These Third-Graders Saw Their Classmate Didn’t Have A Lunch, They Kept Feeding Him More And More Lunches Until He Clogged The Door And Got School Canceled|Email Life can be tough, but students at Willow Creek Elementary School in Duluth, Minnesota, have done something this year that will make you cry tears of joy: When they noticed that a fellow student eating lunch at school, they brought him so many lunches that he clogged the door and school got canceled. Compassion for the win! When caring students saw that 9-year-old Bryce Oswald was showing up to school every day without a lunch, they knew they had to do something. They started giving Bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches, and even pooled their allowances to buy Bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled. Bryce have anything to eat, so we knew we had to help him out, said Willow Creek student Kali Summers. We gave him our lunches every day, even if we got really hungry. We knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we have to go to school. The plan worked perfectly. In a matter of months, Bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on 115 pounds, got stuck in the door, and school got canceled. The students were so successful in plumping Bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out. Mission accomplished! Due to these selfless dedication, not only did Bryce not go hungry, but all of the kids and teachers were able to stay home from school to play, watch TV, and relax instead of going to school for a full two days. They stopping there, either: Even though Bryce is now bigger than any other student in the district, the kids are going to continue to give him lunches in hopes that he can get stuck in the door so tightly that school gets canceled for a full week. Beautiful! Adults could learn a thing or two about kindness and commitment to your dreams from these remarkable kids.|2022-09-29 02:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Insight|294310|71112|124|610|Spain|English|2022-09-12 15:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|979200|2401200|1965|2.066666666666667

Resolution L.41 (pdf) was accepted by a vote of 123-38, with 16 member nations abstaining. The vote was held during a meeting of the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, which deals with disarmament and international security matters. For seven decades, the UN has warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons, and people globally have campaigned for their abolition. Today the majority of states finally resolved to outlaw these weapons, said Beatrice Fihn, executive director of International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear weapons (ICAN). Setsuko Thurlow , a survivor of the Hiroshima and leading proponent of a ban, also celebrated vote. This is a truly historic moment for the entire world, Thurlow said. For those of us who survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it is a very joyous occasion. We have been waiting so long for this day to come. As expected, nuclear powers including the United States, France, Canada, Israel, Russia, and the United Kingdom, as well as several of their European allies, were among the nations who voted against the ban.

5632|Before It All Began: DML’s Spot-On Prediction of the 2016 Race|by Dean Daniels / November 7, 2016 / POLITICS / In the summer of 2015 before the current presidential race ignited, and two weeks before Trump announced his candidacy, DML gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of Massachusetts. In front of an audience at a small town synagogue, the award-winning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others: putting Americans first. DML emphasizes during his Americans first speech that the number one issue in America is immigration. He explains in crystal clear detail how immigration, both legal and illegal, goes beyond party identification. He says not a Democrat or Republican issue an American issue. Having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself, DML got a real sense for what concerned Americans most. Therefore, he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of 2016 would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the American people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants. Remember, not an anti-immigration; an anti-illegal immigration; and about being pro-America. While putting Americans first would have been campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land, this strategy was instead adopted by none other than Donald J.Trump. This is one major reason why DML has supported Trump since day one. Trump has done more than proven DML correct. Trump has proven how powerful the Americans first ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the American people who are left to rot on the back burner.

566|Chris Christie says debt-free college is 'wrong'|As Democratic presidential candidates begin to include a debt-free college system as part of their respective campaigns, New Jersey Gov. and Republican contender Chris Christie thinks the push is a typical liberal approach. Christie stopped at Iowa State University Thursday to deliver his fourth most recent policy address. Among his talking points were dealing with unions and how to handle the increasing costs of college. That is a typical liberal approach. It is wrong, he said. If college graduates are going to reap the greater economic rewards and opportunities of earning a degree, then it seems fair for them to support the cost of the education receiving. Christie spoke about his father joining the army in order to pay for college, because his father, at the time, afford to pay for his own education. He went to Rutgers University after his service through the G.I. Bill. We all need to take personal responsibility to grasp the opportunities in higher education, but also one where we can get a leg up when we need it, Christie said. Rather than make higher education free for students, Christie instead proposed that Congress support low-income students by continuing to fund aid programs. He noted that while Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Perkins Loans have declined, the availability of Pell grants has expanded. But that may not be the case according to a March 2015 study by The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which found Pell grant funding is actually being cut. Christie also said there should be tax breaks for donors to higher education grant organizations and income-share agreements. This would allow a student to repay the private financing he or she received for college with a percentage of his or her future income. What do you think? Is a debt-free college realistic? How can students combat increasing costs of higher education?|2022-09-28 22:00:00|REAL|Maxwell Rivera|Express Tribune|737803|63635|346|0|Algeria|English|2022-09-20 11:00:00|Reportaje|0|True|1656000|2386800|1885|5.766666666666667

5673|HIV ‘Cure’ Almost Complete after Scientists Remove Virus’s DNA from Living Tissue|Research could serve as a curative approach for patients with scientist says Scientists have managed to remove DNA of the HIV virus from living tissue for the first time in a breakthrough that could lead to an outright cure. At the moment, treating the disease involves the use of drugs that suppress levels of the virus so the immune system can cope. Now researchers in the US have revealed they used gene-editing technology to remove DNA of the commonest HIV-1 strain from several organs of infected mice and rats. In April, the same team reported that they had successfully eliminated the virus from human cells in the laboratory, but a paper in the journal Nature Gene Editing revealed they had managed to do the same thing in live animals for the first time. The team leader, Professor Kamel Khalili, of Temple University, said: In a proof-of-concept study, we show[ed] that our gene-editing technology can be effectively delivered to many organs of two small animal models and excise large fragments of viral DNA from the host cell genome. The current antiretroviral drugs for HIV are not able to eliminate HIV-1 from the infected cells. And if treatment is interrupted, the virus can start replicating quickly, putting patients of risk of getting full-blow AIDS. This is because it is able to persist in immune system T-cells and other places where it is not actually active and is unaffected by the current treatments. The researchers used a specially adapted virus to deliver the gene-editing system into the cells. The ability of the rAAV delivery system to enter many organs containing the HIV-1 genome and edit the viral DNA is an important indication that this strategy can also overcome viral reactivation from latently infected cells and potentially serve as a curative approach for patients with HIV, Professor Khalili said. In a statement, Temple University said the implications of the new study were far-reaching. The gene-editing platform by itself may be able to eradicate HIV-1 DNA from patients, but it is also highly flexible and potentially could be used in combination with existing antiretroviral drugs to further suppress viral RNA. It also could be adapted to target mutated strains of HIV-1, it added. Professor Khalili said a clinical trial could happen within the next few years, but he first planned to carry out a similar study involving a larger group of animals.

Many cannot fathom or conceive just how vile the followers of the murderous paedophile can be. incomprehensible. Even animals that have been traumatised and abused behave like that when rescued. Europeans have mostly been peaceful for the last 70 years because they made a concerted effort to live in peace and to uphold dignity of life and human rights. That came at a price. Followers of the paedophile savage are socialised differently. They are pathetic and emotionally infantile. In the West we are taught to take personal responsibility for our actions. They are taught to blame everyone but themselves often turning victims into the guilty in the case of raped women. In the West violent displays of anger are frowned upon and we are taught to apologise for our wrong doIngs. Muslims have a warped and messed up sense of honour. An honour they will gladly kill their families to restore. In short they accept everything that is a crime in our countries as somehow permissible. Incompatible. In the West they are given human rights they deserve and freedoms they handle. Proven recipe for disaster. You have to be very very naive to believe that people who are fed a steady diet of intolerance, opression and hatred since birth will miraculously change just because they cross a border from hell hole to civilsed country.

The book contains the descriptions of the cases, when the US-led coalition was committing ""errors,"" as John Kerry once said. However, those ""errors"" can be categorized as war crimes . The actions of the Syrian ""moderate opposition"" are also reflected in the document. The 'White Book"" also contains statistics about the successful operations of the Russian Air Force and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in Syria, about the number of the liberated settlements, destroyed militants, as well as about the number of refugees, who returned to their places of permanent residence.The ""White Book"" was prepared by the Defence Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Russia, as well as by specialists of the Institute for Oriental Studies.The ""White Book"" was translated into English and distributed for further reading.On 21 October the coalition attacked a funeral procession in near Kirkuk (Iraq). The pilots took the congregation of people for terrorists. As a result, dozens of civilians were killed. The recent attack of US pilots on the Syrian military near Deir-Ezzor also claimed the lives of dozens of soldiers. Later, US Secretary of State John Kerry, in a conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, said that it was a mistake, apparently believing that such a statement would be enough for an excuse.""We have repeatedly said that such deadly attacks on settlements that have all attributes of war crimes, have become almost daily routine for the international lcoalition,"" an official representative for the Russian Defense Ministry, Igor Konashenkov said commenting o the attack of the funeral procession in Iraq.

However, the Republican Party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts, and hopes for visions. Trump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory. It takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles. Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office.

After accruing millions of dollars in debt, the Nobel prize committee will forgo a lavish award ceremony in favor of a webcast hosted by Carrot Top from a drive thru coffee kiosk. Nobel Committee head Jørgen Myklebust is putting his experience in marketing for Supermac's to the task with the new drive thru format for this years award ceremony. He explained the decision when he talked to reporter Rance Penning of the Daily Maul. ""This will be the first year in a decade we don't lose money: the webcast costs us virtually nothing and Carrot Top has agreed to MC the award ceremony in exchange for a Nobel prize in chemistry. And having Carrot Top as the host is already giving us a boost with advertisers."" Myklebust further explained: ""The nominees will be able to stream the webcast while in the parking lot at NK Stockholm, and the winners will drive up to the kiosk window to get their awards."" When Penning asked if the entire Nobel operation was moving to the kiosk, Myklebust dismissed the question as silly. ""You know, it's not serious to ask if we are keeping our offices in the kiosk, of course our whole staff will not fit in a kiosk. For those who are curious, we'll continue to maintain our office space in a camping tent outside Tom Schuyler's house."" This reporter visited with Carrot Top to talk about the new gig. I had a few minutes with him in his Las Vegas dressing room as his assistants made him up for that nights show. ""I can't wait to go to Sweden,"" said Scott Thompson (Carrot Top's real name). ""I can go incognito, you know, I don't stand out as a ginger there."" When asked about props for the webcast, the beloved orange one jumped up and grabbed some vials and a butane torch from a toy box. ""Oh, yeah! Since my Nobel prize is in chemistry, I'm bringing my Meth Lab chemistry set, I should probably save that for the end of the show in case I blow anything up!"" ""And for sure I'm bringing my tip jar!"" At which point Thompson showed this reporter an actual glass jar with a credit card reader embedded in it.

The Jewish Algemeiner writes that the 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the of their founder, Martin Luther. The truth of the matter is that Martin Luther know about Zionism, Israeli criminality, Alan Dershowitz, Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein, or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews. Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies , a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion. Rabbi Abraham dean of the Simon Wiesenthal the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to directly address the issue (of anti-Semitism) in the overall context of what celebrating in terms of this anniversary, David Michaels of insists that the churches reject some of their teachings. This reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of hateful beliefs about Jews, wherever these persist. The Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism. But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do. It fails to brief us about argument against the Jews. The truth of the matter is that animus towards Jewry at all racially driven. His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological. Thus, using the term in reference to Luther is misleading. It leaves one wondering whether Bnai and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an If they do, we may actually need to seek the assistance of book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and conduct.

5700|Hillary Emails: “Taken Care Of”|"Hillary Emails: Taken Care Of October 28, 2016 Hillary Clinton waves to the crowd after delivering her ''official launch speech'' at a campaign kick off rally in Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island in New York City, June 13, 2015. Recently released email show a Clinton campaign manager pretty confident that ""everything was taken care of"", It is believed he referred to Clinton's email usage. Members of what would become Hillary campaign team discussed her use of a private email account as secretary of state in Summer 2014, months before her email practices were publicly revealed. But an email released on Thursday shows that Robby Mook, campaign manager, was not overly concerned about the issue at that time because he was told that everything was taken care of. It is not clear what Mook meant by the cryptic statement, which he made in an exchange with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The email, which was hacked from Gmail account and released by WikiLeaks, is the first to show that the Clinton team was caught almost completely off guard by The New York March 2, 2015 story about email usage. The late-night email exchange happened within hours of the New York Times breaking the news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account in a way that may have broken records rules. Did you have any idea of the depth of this story? Podesta asked Mook in the email. At 1:32 a.m., Mook wrote back: ""Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of."" The exchange appears to show that even Clinton's most senior aides were initially unprepared for the scale of revelations about Clinton's email practices, which would end up dogging her campaign all the way through to the final weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 election. After a yearlong investigation, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in July that Clinton and her staff were ""extremely careless"" with classified information, but that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges."|2022-09-07 05:00:00|FAKE|Victoria Singh|Express Tribune|61158|18436|290|8179|Nigeria|English|2022-09-07 03:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|511200|504000|2078|4.833333333333333

Today is a very sad day for democracy within the UK, and Theresa May a Remain supporter is instrumental in denying the will of the British people to leave the EU. Dithering and Delaying Tactics Through numerous delaying tactics , and the installation of key government posts of Remain campaign MPs, the Brexit referendum was thwarted. If the government had repealed the 1972 European Communities Act immediately the EU referendum result would be well on the way to materialising. The total nonchalance and denial of the EU referendum result is firmly on Theresa head and her appointment of Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer was a further sign that May was not serious about the EU referendum result. Injustice The High Court ruling today which is intrusive and false, as well as being undemocratic is a further signal that we are currently not living in a sovereign nation and it is totally controlled by Brussels. During the EU Referendum, MPs had their say , MPs campaigned, and when it came to vote in the referendum, they voted. Therefore, parliament has already had a say in the EU referendum, and by going to the High Court, these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on June 23 2016. This ruling is a shameful reminder that Britain has lost all sovereign status to the EU entity, it is a sad day for democracy, for the will of the people and ultimately for the country. 17.5 Million People Will Vote on Election Day In these circumstances, we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any MP or party who is EU centric.

5709|Life: 7 Incredible Animal Mating Rituals|7 Incredible Animal Mating Rituals Posted today Email You know the birds and the bees. What about the rest? Here are seven mating rituals that showcase nature in all its complexity and beauty. Orangutans: Orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle, meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky, male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon, only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it. Armadillos: In the song, the male penis makes an annoying high-pitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him. Alligators: During mating season, male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them. Beavers: The male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers, taking a step closer to one another as they do so. At some point, they get so close that actually mating. Elephants: Before having sex, the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky, boiling hot Pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when in the mood. Iguanas: When it is time for iguanas to mate, the male iguana climbs on top of a female fox and the female iguana climbs on top of a male fox. The two iguanas ride their foxes straight at each other at full speed, and when the foxes collide with each other, the iguanas are flung forward and collide in midair. As they fly through the air, the male iguana impregnates the female iguana, who sprays eggs in all directions as she hurtles haphazardly toward the sky. When the mating ritual is complete, both iguanas hit the ground and die. Bonobos: The male bonobo spends a full year trying to work up the courage to ask for a kiss. If he is rejected or the kiss that good, he will crawl up a tree and scream at God for giving him such good lips for kissing but no one to share them with.|2022-10-01 20:00:00|FAKE|Daniel Patel|The Chronicle|542086|38557|151|4822|Spain|English|2022-09-04 19:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|302400|2638800|2088|2.5166666666666666

5734|Ammon Bundy’s bodyguard sentenced in Oregon standoff case|PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 26 (UPI) Brian Cavalier, the personal bodyguard of Ammon Bundy, on Tuesday was sentenced to time served in custody, exactly 9 months, for his role in the 41-day Oregon wildlife refuge standoff earlier this year. U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown delivered the sentence in a downtown Portland federal courthouse. fulfilled the custody provision of the sentence, Brown told Cavalier, who remains under U.S. Marshals Service custody while awaiting transfer to Nevada where he faces federal charges from a 2014 armed standoff. Cavalier pleaded guilty on June 29 to one charge of conspiring to prevent federal workers from the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service from carrying out official work through intimidation, threat or force, and one charge of possession of a firearm in a federal facility. Cavalier will also face three years of post-prison supervision that would begin after or occur concurrently with any supervision ordered by Nevada should Cavalier be sentenced in that case, The Oregonian reports. Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy, and five others including Cavalier were charged with conspiracy, while other defendants have been charged with theft of government property and carrying a firearm in a federal facility, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The Oregon incident began in early January in the town of Burns, where protesters were voicing support for ranchers Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven, 46, who were convicted of arson in 2012 and served time in prison but whose sentences a court later ruled were too short. The protesters, led by Bundy, would later occupy Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in a tense 41-day standoff with federal authorities. Bundy is the son of Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher who gained international attention in 2014 after staging an armed standoff with federal authorities over a grazing dispute with the Bureau of Land Management. Cavalier will stand trial for the 2014 Nevada standoff in February. He is the first of the 26 defendants indicted in the Oregon conspiracy case.|2022-10-02 01:00:00|FAKE|Madison Wong|Echo News|324829|5527|83|8808|Thailand|English|2022-09-09 05:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2656800|684000|2072|1.3833333333333333

5740|Scientists believe they have found ET|Scientists believe they have found ET Oct 28, 2016 Previous post Scientists have heard hugely unusual messages from deep in space that they think are coming from aliens, reports the Independent . A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. And there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis, write EF Borra and E Trottier in a new paper. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis, the two scientists from Laval University in Quebec write.

In an email released by WikiLeaks , the now infamous Clinton staffer John Podesta sent a message to Clinton surrogate Neera Tanden. Podesta told her be shown a new poll showing how Clinton is doing against Hillary and Jeb Bush. Tanden said she familiar with what the poll results would be, but she thought the email would be rough, IJR is reporting . PS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee? To which Tanden replied: Well, see what the poll actually says. hope the Democratic party is not suicidal. Then Podesta dropped the hammer: Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered? Like whole thing is fucking insane.

5759|DNC Head Leaked 2nd Debate Question to Hillary|DNC Head Leaked 2nd Debate Question to Hillary October 31, We're not talking about Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the ex-muppet in charge of the DNC who was forced to resign because of the way the DNC rigged the process to favor Hillary. This is Donna Brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the DNC. Since Brazile is another Clinton loyalist, that was never going to happen. But the latest leak reveals that Brazile had passed along a second debate question to Hillary. All this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was. Another leaked email has emerged showing Democratic National Committee boss and former CNN contributor Donna Brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the Hillary Clinton campaign -- despite Brazile's persistent claims to the contrary. CNN announced in a statement soon after the email became public Monday that Brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on Oct. 14, days after the controversy over Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign initially broke. According to documents released Monday by WikiLeaks, Brazile sent Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri an email titled, One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash, the night before the March 6 CNN primary debate in Flint, Mich. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint, Brazile wrote. The following night, Lee-Anne Walters, a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the Flint water contamination crisis, posed a question to both Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, and her primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton responded with a lengthy answer that moderator Anderson Cooper had to twice interrupt in an attempt to keep to the agreed-upon time limit. How pervasive is this kind of thing in the process?

5766|Harry Reid BLASTS Comey For Misconduct, Drops Bombshell: FBI Is Sitting On Russian-Trump Info|The decision of FBI Director Comey to go public with a supposed investigation into new Hillary emails was welcomed by Trump as the mainstream media recklessly reported on this total dud of a controversy. It basically dominated the news cycle all day and probably will until we all cast out our vote next Tuesday (or November 28th if you support Trump.) But the politically motivated and reckless actions of Comey have many outraged, including Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid Senator Reid appeared with Clinton today to push back against the inappropriate, unprecedented, and puzzling move by FBI Director James Comey to suddenly go public with new emails. Roughly two months removed from retirement, Reid is waging an all-out war on Comey as he claims a disturbing double standard took place in the decision to publish this misleading announcement while essentially ignoring Trump. Reid pointed specifically to information the FBI allegedly has that ties Trump to Russia information Reid says they have intentionally sat on in order to not hurt the chances of being elected. He expressed his ire in a blistering letter to Comey. a key passage: Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. And not as though one can accuse Reid of being blindly partisan since he previously defended Comey when Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination and subsequently delay his confirmation. Reid wrote: I believed you to be a principled public servant. The actions of Comey were indeed politically motivated as he desperately wished to be loved again by law & order conservatives. But Reid just opened up a whole new can of worms.

5769|27 Civilians Killed in Saudi Airstrikes Against Yemen Villages|Attacks Destroyed Villagers' Homes, Burned Farms by Jason Ditz, October 30, 2016 Share This While the biggest single Saudi airstrike over the weekend in Yemen targeted a prison in Hodeidah, dozens of other strikes were reported over the weekend by villagers around Taiz and in the Maarib Province, with attacks killing at least 27 civilians , and wounding a number of others. Most of the casualties were in Taiz, where attacks destroyed several homes and caused a large number of injuries. With hospitals in the area having very limited access to medicine because of the naval blockade, many of those injuries proved fatal. The attacks in Maarib and Saada, however, may prove more devastating to the country in the long run, targeting some of the very limited farmland Yemen has, destroying a number of homes and burning a lot of that farmland. Yemen has to import some 90 percent of its food under normal circumstances, with such imports severely limited by the blockade, and the loss of farmland just adds to food insecurity in the nation. Saudi Arabia has been coming under growing international criticism for its air war against Yemen, with massive numbers of civilians killed and little sign that the promised improvements to targeting will ever amount to anything.

5793|Rebels Escalate Attacks on Western Aleppo, Killing 12 Civilians|Attacks Ramp Up Ahead of Russia's New Ceasefire by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This A coalition of Syrian rebels led by the Nusra Front have been attacking government-held Western Aleppo since Friday, and escalated the strikes ahead of new ceasefire. Reports out of the city suggest heavy firing against government-held neighborhoods. While details are still emerging, 12 civilians were reported slain in the firing, and around 200 others were wounded . This toll is independent of the toll from fighting on the ground between rebels and military forces, for which no official figures have yet been released. The Russian ceasefire is intended to offer a 10-hour window during which the rebels can leave the city freely through two corridors, taking their weapons and anything else with them, though the rebels have already denounced both the offer and the ceasefire, insisting they will never surrender the city. Both sides have been trading fire for months, often shelling one neighborhoods, attacks which tend to kill a lot more civilian bystanders than combatants. They also trade offensives and counteroffensives, aiming to take control of the entire city. So far, neither side has been able to get serious gains in the fighting over the city. Some smaller gains by the Syrian military last month appear to be getting reversed with this new offensive by the rebels from outside the city.

5795|Trump Has Gotten The Republican Party Sued For Trying To Intimidate Voters|The Washington Post reported : The Democratic National Committee has filed papers in federal court against the Republican National Committee, accusing it of violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation. The motion filed in New Jersey says the RNC has supported the efforts of presidential candidate Donald campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on Election Day. Democrats going to stand by and let Trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily Democratic areas to intimidate voters. call for his supporters to go to polling places that their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree. The Republican Party, which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas, is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop Trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning. People should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote. No matter who you are voting for, Democrats have your back. The Republican Party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years. Democrats are on to their tricks, and as the lawsuit demonstrates, Trump and the GOP are not going to get away with intimidating voters.|2022-09-28 02:00:00|FAKE|Amelia Rivera|The Reporter|939944|5922|76|3531|Sudan|English|2022-09-03 08:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|2314800|176400|1418|1.2666666666666666

5808|Vote Vote Vote|link originally posted by: JinMI Lots of discussion over the past months. Who we're for or who we're against and platitudes of statements...some not so much. Whomever you decide to give your vote to honestly does not concern me nor should mine concern you. The debates, arguments and discussions are fun and generally informative. Vote for who you would, even if it takes a few hours. I've seen quite a bit of conversation of folks not wanting to vote at all. What does this prove? What is this standing (sitting) against? Your disapproval of the two party system or maybe you think the whole thing a charade? My opinion would leave me to believe that if your going to attempt to rebel against the system it would be a secure third party vote or a vote for the future so to speak. We as Americans need to take back our power over Government. There is more than just the Presidency at stake and to me I would think that not voting at all is a contribution to the apathy that has us in the situation we are in. Whether it be Trump or Drumf or Hillary or Shillary or Stein or Johnson or Joe Blow, I would urge you to vote! If you are not voting at all, would you please elaborate as to why? I'm trying to imagine the next president of the USA being Joe Blow. Well now President Blow, what do you think of the Cannabis trade with Mexico?

5809|Refugees scooped out of Lake Erie|"Topics: Donald Trump , Canada , Walls Monday, 14 November 2016 Canadian border control boats rescued almost 800 US Americans yesterday seeking to escape the USA in dinghis across Lake Erie. All were wearing T-shirts declaring 'We love maple syrup' and were humming tunes by Justin Bieber and Katie Moore. They were returned to their port of departure in Vermilion, Ohio and initially catered for in a local sports hall. Hundreds of vessels have been spotted on the Great Lakes of Huron, Ontario, Superior and Erie since the election of Donal Trump last week. US state officials confirmed that Trump is considering building a wall along the border with Canada to keep his countrymen in. Applications for courses in Inuinnaqtun, the indigenous language of the Inuit, have been flooding in to adult education colleges on the USA side. Many are hoping this will enhance their chances of being accepted within Canadian territory. French is also a favorite (English too, incidentally), though President Trudeau of Canada voiced concern about developments. ""We are a peaceful nation, but also a thoughtful one. An influx of US Americans will of course bring about a collapse in our overall IQ levels, and our average weight figures will inevitably rocket. But we intend to be a haven for all who are suffering and are heavy-laden..."" ""Those bear-hugging, Eskimo-phobic geeks wanting to quit can go"", scowled Trump in his inimitable diplomatic tone. ""Once the wall's up....and they'll pay for it you bet they will.... they'll think twice. And I'm goona put mines in the Lakes...Now that really will be eerie....get it?.."" Make T.

The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. {snip} The analysis also found that the growth in the birthrate of America is entirely driven by immigrants. While the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970, said Pew. This growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births.

5819|Biden and Trump Agree to Fight Pistol Duel--Final Arrangements Pending|"Thursday, 27 October 2016 Biden and Trump to Duel Seeking to duplicate, if not surpass, the famous duel between Vice President Aaron Burr and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, Republican candidate for president, Donald Trump, and Vice President Joe Biden, agreed to fight a pistol duel. Although details of the duel have yet to be finalized, Amiko Aventurista, reports the duel will likely take place on the eve of the election. Three independent sources confirmed negotiations over broadcast rights are extremely tense. Trump demands the duel be the inaugural show of his new venture, Trump TV. ""It was my idea. I was the one who said I could shot someone on Fifth Avenue and my supporters would be with me. Other than Hilary, Obama, Rubio, Cruz, Jeb Bush, and a ton of others, I can think of no one better to shot than hair plug Joe. I'm the greatest shooter ever. A real sniper."" Biden insist MSNBC must be the broadcaster because its liberal and minority audience wants to see Trump with several gun shots. In a response to Trump, Biden said, ""There is no way I can miss. His hair glows bright orange. All I have to do is point toward the glow"". Megan Kelly of Fox says Fox must host the show because she wants to see ""blood"" coming everywhere out of Trump just like he said blood was coming out of her. CNN's Wolf Blitzer decline to comment. Even ESPN is making a play for the event, pointing out it regularly shows non-traditional sporting events, such as bull riding, cross bow, and bowling. Both sides agree Lin Manuel Mirada, producer of the hit Broadway show, Alexander Hamilton, should direct the event. Manuel Mirada said, ""I would be honored to produce the event. I know my smash Broadway hit, Hamilton, is only a show about a duel not a real duet but I think that experience qualifies me to produce a show about a real duel. After all, the only difference is the guns are real."" The National Rifle Association (NRA) has agreed to fully pay for and sponsor the event.

5820|15 Secret iPhone Codes And Tricks|Share on Facebook A list of secret Apple iPhone codes that can unlock a raft of hidden features and settings has been revealed, allowing users to do anything from enhancing their call quality to checking their mobile balance. While Android is particularly well known for offering a rabbit-hole of an operating system that can be tweaked and tinkered with, Apple's iOS has kept menus and settings relatively simple and locked down. However, there is a way that users can drill down to find some gems not seen on the surface. If you want to find out how many minutes you have left on your phone tariff, what your IMEI number (something you'll need if you swap phone networks) or even find out a way to enhance your iPhone's voice quality there's a way to do it that you find by going to your normal phone's settings. Redmond Pie revealed a full list of the codes and how to use them. By typing in the following secret USSD codes on the dialpad of the phone then pressing the call button you can bring up these tricks: *3001#12345#*: Field Test mode *#5005*7672#: SMS centre number *3370#: Turn on or off EFR (Enhanced Full Rate), a mode that improves your iPhone's call quality *#06#: Find out your iPhone's IMEI number *#31#: Hide your number on calls option *#43#: Check if call waiting is on or off *43#: Turn on call waiting #43#: Turn off call waiting *646#: Check minutes left on contract *225#: Find out your current mobile account balance *777#: Find out prepaid account balance *#61#: Number of missed calls *#21#: Call forwarding status *#67#: Call forwarding number *#33#: Find out what mobile services are disabled on your phone One of the most interesting of the USSD codes is the Field Test mode, which allows users to see their phone-signal strength measured in numbers rather than those five bars. You'll see something displaying such as with the number going up and down depending on signal. A value above -80 is a full-bar strength, but anything below -110 is very weak. This is a more accurate way of seeing whether you have enough signal to make a call, rather than holding on to hope with one-bar. It's worth noting that you should only use these codes and play around with your settings at your own risk, if you're not sure what something does better leave it be.

There was fighting everywhere. You pray to be in jail with Libyans, because they do not recognize the current government, they will do what they want.

5828|Make America Vote Again|0 Add Comment A GRASSROOTS movement which has distilled myriad frustrations and anger into one simple, catch all phrase continues to gather pace on the ground in America this morning. Providing a slogan to a loose affiliation of desires, which often directly contradict or compromise the various factions involved, the populist movement is expanding at a worrying rate. American Vote the name given to vast swathes of people who feel America really needs to vote again a second time to get it right, has seen large crowds gather at numerous rallies across the United States. Wrong was the repeated phrase voiced by speakers at the rallies, as they cited the fact that America was headed in the wrong direction as evidence it needed a revolution in order to place it back on the right path. Many media personnel in attendance sought to press rally goers on the finer points of their plan to make America vote again, but could only shout America vote repeatedly. Followers of the movement also displayed an almost violent patriotic loyalty to the 1st Amendment of the Constitution, which they claim Donald Trump would dismantle once in power. heartwarming to see such large crowds. But, where were you assholes yesterday, shared one of the leaders Hillary Clinton. Clinton, criticised for her populism which has seen her join the calls for another vote, is looking to tap into the sort of post-Brexit come down, which saw half of Britain their and wish they could vote all over again.

From Politico : Among the names most discussed: former undersecretary of state Wendy Sherman, the point person on the Iran deal and a favorite within the State Department; former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns, who now heads the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Nick Burns, the former under secretary of state of political affairs under George W.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) Members of the National Guard in the US state of California were paid excessive bonuses at the height of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and were ordered to repay those bonuses earlier this month after an audit discovered the overpayments. ""That is why I will work together with the Department of Defense and my colleagues in the Senate to explore all options available to hold those responsible for this unacceptable situation accountable and to ensure this never happens again,"" McCain stated on Wednesday. McCain called a Defense Department decision to suspend collection of the payments ""a long overdue first step."" However, he added that thousands of service members and their families, whose lives have been disrupted through no fault of their own, are still waiting for certainty that the problem will be fixed. The Defense Department said earlier on Wednesday that about 2,000 soldiers are affected and that it will set up a system to review each case before any efforts to collect money resume. ..."|2022-10-03 10:00:00|FAKE|Olivia Kumar|The Observer|662830|19070|209|815|Russia|English|2022-09-22 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1864800|2775600|1309|3.4833333333333334

Who's up for another silly attempt to claim that Hillary Clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because she's a woman? This gem comes from Robin Lakoff, a Berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading. Hillary Emailgate Is an Attack on Women 'It's not about emails; it's about public communication by a I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. us. The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? His name was General Petraeus. Thank you. Have a nice day. Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. That escalated quickly. And incoherently. Also I'm pretty sure it's not the 20s or whatever decade Robin is parodying or channeling. But yes, Hillary Clinton is only in this mess because she's a woman. It has nothing to do with anything else. That must be why Albright and Rice weren't in the center of similar scandals. If the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no scandal. Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. Emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech. It's illegal for both public officials of both genders. But Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public stand-in for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails.

5874|Preventing cultural genocide with the Mother Tongue policy in Eritrea|Preventing cultural genocide with the Mother Tongue policy in Eritrea By Thomas C. Mountain Posted on October 27, 2016 by Thomas C. Mountain The small east African nation of Eritrea has implemented the Mother Tongue policy nationwide to prevent cultural genocide within its nine different ethnic groups. This is done by educating all children in tribal environments in their mother tongue until literacy at grade 5. By making sure that the ethnic minorities learn to read and write in their mother tongue the Eritrean Government is making sure that their culture survives as well, for without language one cannot practice your culture. Historically destroying peoples mother tongue is the means used to carry out a policy of cultural genocide with many thousands of dialects having disappeared during the Western colonial and neo colonial era. Today many of the languages that remain are threatened by the children of these ethnic groups not being literate in their mother tongue which will almost inevitably lead to the loss of their identity, their language and their culture. It has not been easy for Eritrea, hammered by global warming, drought, sand, economically disadvantaged due to Western inflicted sanctions and embargoes and with 9 tribes with 9 languages, some of which have never had a written language, the challenge of implementing the Mother Tongue policy for all our tribes has been hard work. It has been well over a decade now that the policy has become the practice nationwide and the next generation of Eritrean youth from all our 9 tribes are literate in their mother tongue, a policy the whole world needs to adopt.

An Iraqi lieutenant -- part of the elite Golden Division special forces fighting to take back Iraq's second city from ISIS -- was stationed at a checkpoint in Bartella, about 25 kilometers to the east of the city, when he spotted some familiar faces Tuesday. Amid a group of refugees fleeing the city's outskirts were his mother, his father, and his nephew, whom the soldier had been separated from for over two years. The soldier gave his name as 1st. Lt.

After embracing a group of adults, including his mother, father and brother, he picks up his young nephew and holds him, walking away from the group.

59|Hillary Clinton Raised $45 Million In Latest Quarter|WASHINGTON Hillary presidential campaign on Wednesday announced a massive fundraising haul in the quarter that ended on June 30, further cementing her status as the clear front-runner in the 2016 race. All told, the Democratic candidate and former secretary of state raised more than $45 million in primary campaign contributions between her campaign announcement in April and the end of June. That figure, according to a Clinton aide, is the most that any candidate has ever raised in their opening quarter, topping President Barack Obama's roughly $42 million in the first quarter of 2011. Clinton's haul would also shatter the previous record for an opening fundraising total by a non-incumbent presidential candidate, which she herself set in the first quarter of 2007. To set that record, she raised $26 million in the first three months of her first presidential campaign while transferring an additional $10 million from her Senate campaign account. At the time, Obama trailed closely behind with $25 million. The Clinton campaign will also report that 91 percent of the donations it received were $100 or less in value. However, the Clinton aide did not have a total for how many individual donors gave to the campaign.|2022-09-22 20:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|City Beat|706437|21405|75|7765|Tanzania|English|2022-09-08 07:00:00|Crítica|1|True|604800|1861200|1227|1.25

American Mirror - October 28, 2016 Comments Hillary Clinton claims the only candidate who will stand up to Vladimir Putin, but also the only candidate who apparently believes the United States is vulnerable enough to not prevent Russia from meddling in the November presidential election. Russian President Putin mocked that notion on Thursday. Vladimir Putin: ""Does anyone really think Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? What,is the US a banana republic?""  Does anyone seriously think that Russia can influence the choice of the American people? Putin told a group of academics in Sochi. Is the U.S. a banana republic? America is a great power. If wrong, correct me. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly blamed Russia for the disclosures of campaign operative emails by Wikileaks. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election, Clinton said at the second presidential debate. And believe me, not doing it to get me elected. doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Anything that goes wrong they blame Russia, Trump told a crowd in Ocala, Florida days later. We are being hacked because we have people who know what they are doing. They always blame Russia.

5910|The 'Pit' in Mom's Stomach Turns to Anger When She Learns Why Her Son Isn't on the School Bus|Share on Twitter Nearly every day, Kathleen Hotard walks down her driveway to meet her son as he gets off the bus. Though he's only five years old, Kenneth has been taking the bus home from school for almost two years. So when Hotard didn't see her son at the bus stop after school, she was afraid. When she learned why he wasn't there, that fear quickly turned to anger. Image Credit: Screenshot/WWL-TV As WWL-TV News reports, Hotard had gone to the bus stop on Monday and waited for her son to appear. When he didn't, the worried mother immediately thought about the terrible things that could have happened. She tells WWL-TV: The driver opened the doors and my child was not on the bus. The driver informed me he was not there and that she didn't know where he was but that he had not gotten on the bus that day. You get this pit in your stomach because you don't know where your child is. You don't know if they're okay or if they're crying for you. Learning why her son hadn't gotten on the bus didn't make things better. Upset that the other children were throwing spitballs that sometimes hit him, Kenneth had told his teacher he had a note from his mother giving him permission to walk home from school. Unfortunately, there was no note, but the school failed to confirm that fact with Hotard. She tells WWL-TV: I was informed my child had lied and said he had a parental note to walk home. I confirmed I never wrote a note, and they confirmed they never saw a note. He said he had misplaced it. After learning that a substitute teacher had taken Kenneth at his word with no follow-up, Hotard is now demanding action from the school. Though she says that she is angry with her son for lying, she also wonders why the school didn't check with her before allowing her son to walk home alone. As for Kenneth, a call to the police from a concerned citizen helped find him. He was found about a half mile from school, heading in the wrong direction down a busy road. He admitted that he got kind of lost trying to get home. The school superintendent has apologized and promised to investigate what went wrong. Hotard hopes that this will be followed by safeguards that will prevent the same thing from happening again. She tells WWL-TV: I want any other parent to ever have to feel what I felt. I want any other child to be on a side of a road by themselves scared.|2022-10-08 00:00:00|FAKE|Nora Patel|Echo News|967338|76626|6|6261|Colombia|English|2022-09-19 01:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|3171600|1533600|2368|0.1

By Jim Hightower Posted on November 3, 2016 by Jim Hightower Evading security cameras in the remote expanse along the U.S. border, three Guatemalans waited till dusk to slip illicitly into our country. This is the stuff of Donald Trump if he were to witness such a scene, we can only imagine the furious rants that would follow. But Trump will never see this scene or even know about it, because facing south, fulminating against Mexicans and assuring his faithful followers that stop illegal entry into the U.S. by building a beautiful, impenetrable wall across our 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Meanwhile, the scene described took place way up north, where rural Vermont connects to Canada. As the New York Times recently reported , This area is a haven for smugglers and cross-border criminal organizations. With so many of our political and security officials obsessed with the southern border, more and more criminal the smuggling of people, drugs, and plagued our 5,500-mile Canadian border, the longest in the world between two countries. Running from the Atlantic to the Pacific through sparsely populated and heavily wooded terrain, often no clear demarcation of where Canada ends and the U.S. begins. Some farms, homes, and businesses actually sprawl across the border. Only about 2,000 agents patrol this vast stretch, and officials concede they even have a good guess of how many people and how much contraband is coming across, or where. So, the question for Mr. Trump is: Shall we wall off Canada, too? And how much of our public treasury, democratic idealism, and international goodwill shall we dump into the folly of militarizing both borders? By simply thinking we can wall the world out, be walling ourselves suicidal.

Mirroring information provided by a former senior law enforcement official that multiple FBI investigations are underway involving potential corruption charges against the Clinton Foundation, the Journal confirms what The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group reported in August . FBI field offices in three cities, specifically, New York, Little Rock and Washington, D.C., were coordinating with the U.S. Attorneys working in those cities. FBI agents in Miami are also joining the probe, TheDCNF has since learned. The Clinton Foundation has numerous programs operating in Haiti, the Caribbean, Latin America and South America. Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation and described the unusual field office initiative as at times a sprawling cross-country effort, the Wall Street Journal reports. Several polls released Saturday and Sunday show a rapid deterioration of presidential nominee Hillary lead in the wake of disclosure by FBI Director James Comey that he is reopening the email server investigation. Comey said in August that he did not believe the investigation of Clinton and her use of private servers and private email addresses to conduct official diplomatic business would be productive. announcement Friday was related to a separate investigation of child pornography allegations against former Rep. Anthony Weiner, a New York Democrat who is married to closest confidant, Huma Abedin. Weiner and Abedin separated earlier this year following a third disclosure of his sexting with an underage girl.

The circus is over and the peanut shells are being swept out of the stands. So what do we have to show for all of it? Well, I have some good news, some bad news, and some not-so-good news for you. start with the bad news. Apparently some people voted for Trump in the belief that he was some sort of anti-establishment truth-telling hero of the working class. I hate to be the one to disabuse you of this notion, so just look at his transition team, his campaign team, the people who have already been tapped to be part of the new administration and the people who are being contacted for potential cabinet appointments.

November 08, 2016 President Obama aboard Marine One departs on the last day of campaigning from the White House. On Election Day Eve, Senior Editor of Charisma Magazine releases an Election Day dream, ""Today, a kingdom will be toppled."" Jennifer LeClaire describes the dream as ""spiritually disturbing"". She shares of the many people that have contacted her with dreams they have had as well. The claims of prophetic messages range from declaring Donald J. Trump as the next commander-in-chief to Obama not handing over the keys to the White House. The visions of chaotic turmoil disrupting in the streets of America have also been very vividly shared. LeClaire like many of us admits that she has never seen such prophetic whirlwind over an election in her lifetime. The night before Election Day she had a dream about the number of prophetic voices and among them she saw some with selfish agendas either for monetary gain or seeking accolades from man. During time of reflection after this powerful dream she assures to have heard these words clearly: Today, a kingdom will be toppled. Although she is still praying over what she believes to have been divinely revealed, the urgency to share the dream was clear. In an interview with TRUNEWS last week LeClaire clearly shared her position as one with a focus on intense prayer. She talked about the importance for the Church to be lead by the spirit and keep their faith on Christ. Original article by Charisma News / TRUNEWS analysis.

(Gee, wonder where they got the idea for the word deplorable?) The guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation, defining the term as the act of displaying cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner. The guide, called My Identity, Not Your Costume, goes on to list several examples of offensive Halloween costumes, featuring pictures of Grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture. In one instance, the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming Call me Caitlyn, referring to Caitlyn Jenner. The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a National Coming Out Day pin, and includes a caption stating, the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture. You just understand this Another example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission , one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic. It then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission , or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture, then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. The guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, Does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke? as well as Why would I find your to be offensive?

5943|North Dakota Police Arrest Over 140 Pipeline Protesters|Carol Adl in News // 0 Comments Hundreds of police in riot gear with heavy military equipment have evicted Dakota Access Pipeline protesters from their encampment on private land in the US state of North Dakota. Police have protesters more or less surrounded. #noDAPL  Jason Patinkin (@JasonPatinkin) October 27, 2016 The police reportedly arrested at least 141 Native Americans and other demonstrators who are seeking to halt construction of a controversial oil pipeline. Press TV reports At least 141 protesters were arrested on Thursday evening and Friday morning as officers attempt to clear a camp on private property in the path of the proposed $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, the Morton County Department said in a statement. Officers in riot helmets used pepper spray and shot beanbag rounds on some of the estimated 330 protesters as helicopters flew overhead. Demonstrators also allegedly set a car and some tires on fire, giving the scene a war zone-like appearance. The protesters have been demonstrating for several months, and dozens have been arrested. Police expect additional protests, and possibly more arrests, in the coming days. Native American protesters had occupied the property that crosses the path since Monday in an effort to stop Energy Transfer construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline has infuriated the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists who say it threatens the water supply and sacred tribal sites. The reservation is close to the route. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said police were successful in clearing the camp. Private property is not the place to carry out a peaceful protest, he said. Demonstrators, however, say they trespassing on private property, citing an 1851 treaty with the US government that says the land belongs to Native American tribes. The Native American-led protest has grown into a larger movement in the United States, drawing in other tribes, environmentalists and advocates for Native Americans. The federal government has twice asked the pipeline operator to voluntarily pause construction near the reservation while the authorities reconsider the route. But courts have refused to compel a halt. The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe criticized law militarized response to the activists. Militarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today.

In Cleveland, if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels we can turn her to regular turnout levels gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area dead heat. So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away. Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations of rigging the election against them. But time and time again been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter especially non-white, male voters . Since the Republicans win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters especially minorities from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. They justify this in an underhanded appeal to protecting the integrity of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of voter fraud over the head. This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist, but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights. The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy, and we must punish them for it at the ballot box.

After all, it takes hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Bill and Hillary, along with the Clinton Foundation board members, to fly around the world in their Boeing 757, and to stay in $13,900/night villas with a 60-foot swimming pool. That kind of luxury going to pay for itself! Oh, between the opulence and president Bill Clinton and his donors stopped to serve meals to 250 underprivileged children in Jaipur, India on July 16, 2014. I wonder how many more meals, medicine, or school supplies could have been provided with an extra $13,900. This is a typical Clinton Foundation site visit. According to The Daily Caller : The trip provides a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the Clinton Foundation and dozens of its wealthiest donors all done in the name of charity, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation The Clinton excesses on this particular trip were seen in several Third World nations. Indonesian officials, for example, warned the foundation that Pangkalan Bun landing strip was too short for the Boeing 757 and that the party would have to switch to a smaller aircraft. Officially, the Indonesian stop was to visit a Clinton Climate Initiative project where a local forest preserve was being cultivated to offset carbon emissions. But flying 41 people donors, their families and foundation staff aboard an aircraft designed for nearly 300 sent the carbon footprint sky 757 and Gulfstream burned 60,000 gallons of jet fuel, worth at least $220,000 using current commercial aviation rates. Sixty thousands gallons of jet fuel produced 200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, enough energy to power 21 average U.S. homes for a year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

On Monday, an online petition calling for the teens to see jail time had garnered some 21,000 signatures. The sexual self-determination and integrity of a woman must have more weight than any concern for the perpetrators, [of sexual crimes,] says the petition. According to an update on the Change.org petition, state prosecutors in Hamburg have said they will explore a way to make sure that the teens are punished despite laws that make it difficult for minors to be prosecuted and sentenced to detention.|2022-09-26 20:00:00|FAKE|Owen Rodriguez|The Daily Dispatch|994809|79865|34|8680|Japan|English|2022-09-22 14:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1839600|2206800|913|0.5666666666666667

Some may think this is arrogance on her part but not. reflective of her confidence in the ability to rig voting machines on a massive scale that her campaign has invested heavily in. Bev Harris of Black Box Voting shows how easy it is for an experienced programmer in this case Bennie Smith with access to the network to change the results of an election without anyone knowing or being able to detect it has happened. The process uses a fractional counting methodology to alter the vote totals and arrive at pre-determined totals for each candidate through the use of a software patch called the gems program. When Ms. Harris first discovered the gems program it was installed and counting votes in 25 states and 616 jurisdictions. She has now uncovered evidence that fractional counting has migrated from the gems program exclusively into other vendors voting systems which count votes as fractions and may count as many as ninety-nine percent of all American votes in the 2016 election. There are some things we can do to protect our vote but not as simple as we would like it to be. It requires a degree of vigilance and a little effort on your part. Voting machines are required to take pictures of every ballot. Ask for a copy after you vote. Also, you can observe and document the central tabulator at your county elections office by making a video recording of what seeing. Remember, the precinct voting machine you vote on should print a results page. Ask to see it and compare it to how you voted. We can no longer trust those in control of the levers of power to protect us. The establishment has betrayed us too many times in the past for us to trust them with our votes now. up to you to protect the integrity of your vote.

RIP Mark political career. Thoughts and prayers. In what may be the biggest foot in mouth moment of any political campaign since Todd self-immolation, Kirk, who is running for U.S. Senate against the very popular Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D) to represent Illinois, decided to use the senate debate stage to go completely and profoundly racist. It started when Duckworth told voters about her families long military tradition, one that dates back all the way to the Revolutionary War. Her point was a good one. Her family has sacrificed for the country for generations and far too many politicians flippantly go to war without thinking about who they will put in harms way. My family has served this nation in uniform going back to the revolution. I am a daughter of the American Revolution. bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound because people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say this is what it costs and this is what asking us to do. And if the case, go. families like mine that bleed first. But make sure that the American people understand what we are engaging in and hold our allies accountable because we do it all. Kirk interjected by saying a line that will haunt him for the rest of his very short career. I had forgotten your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington. A problem: family did fight in the Revolutionary War. Kirk assumed because she was of mixed heritage that they have. Mark Kirk is not a smart man. She's an active DAR member. And Sen. @MarkKirk lied about his own military questioning her family's military service. Brandon Friedman (@BFriedmanDC) October 28, 2016 The stunned silence both from the moderator and from Sen. Duckworth kind of say it all. So long, Mark Kirk. Have a good retirement!

The vice admiral claimed the US knows both where the ships came from and where they were going because they interviewed the crews of the captured ships. Only one of the four putative weapons ships was validated by the United Nations as being an actual smuggling attempt. Donegan went on to claim that he believes Iran is connected in some way to recent incidents of missiles fired at a US ship off the Yemeni coast, though the Pentagon conceded one of those incidents likely never happened, and he offered no evidence of Iranian involvement in anything else. The allegations were likely made by way of justifying US attacks on the Yemeni coast, as well as justifying Saudi ongoing naval blockade of Yemen, which Saudi Arabia recently denied is happening.|2022-09-30 12:00:00|FAKE|Jacob Gupta|Voice of the Nation|566704|44478|111|4614|Nigeria|English|2022-09-23 15:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|1929600|2523600|1033|1.85

Citing the perfect societal conditions for a swell in dissatisfaction and disquiet brought on by divisive rhetoric, isolation and amplified fears to fester, much of the American population was in agreement that an assassination is something that could conceivably I not celebrate it, were it to happen, which is really fucking depressing when I think about it.

Experts in slowly unraveling individuals with access to guns even speculated that the ultimate cause of the assassination may be seemingly insignificant. Right now, no one is focused enough to remember Trump said he would release his tax returns, but when he delays that disclosure again and again, someone who never really gave a shit about that might start studying a map of tall buildings surrounding his victory parade route in New York.

6033|The Old Democrat Wall Street Plus Identity Politics Playbook is Dead|by Yves Smith Yves here. This is a very important video from the Real News Network , and I wish there were a transcript, so do take the trouble to listen to it. One of the reasons for the ferocity of the howling from the Democratic Party hackocracy in the wake of the unexpected Trump vicory is that they are effectively cornered animals. As political scientist Tom Ferguson explains, the Democrats get the number of voters they need with their traditional coalition of Big Finance money plus identity politics without delivering tangible benefits to workers, which they have abjectly failed to do. But the power of mone in the Democratic party makes it well nigh impossible for them to devise the sort of populist policies that would appeal to voters that Trump has successfully peeled off. Ferguson also has some important exit poll and early, granular data that debunks some cherished Democratic party myths. For instance, playing the gender card as successful as the media would lead you to believe. Ferguson, who has been a consistent critic of the Democrats from the left, does not rule out the idea that Trump could deliver on policies that would make him popular, most important, ones that would create more jobs and improve wages. One expert close to the Sanders camp came to the same view separately months ago. So while Trump may be stymied, or may never have been sincere about his battle call to downtrodden workers, a mistake to rule out the possibility that he will continue to succeed despite the odds and his glaring character defects. 0 0 0 0 0 1|2022-09-20 11:00:00|FAKE|Madison Wong|Newsflash|358119|98699|215|3882|Kenya|English|2022-09-09 13:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|712800|1656000|1564|3.5833333333333335

Vanga allegedly called the election of Barack Obama as well, predicting the 44th president of the United States would be an African American also making the chilling claim that he would be the U.S. Usually, be happy to dismiss the reaction to prophetic prediction as the public clinging onto a ray of hope in new political climate, but actually, the blind mystic has a pretty great track record with her visions. The prophetess, who died aged 85 in 1996, is alleged to have made hundreds of predictions about the future with an 85 per cent accuracy rate, from her home in Petrich, Bulgaria. These prediction include climate change and the melting of the polar ice caps, which she allegedly foresaw back in the 1950s, saying: cold regions will become warm and volcanoes will awaken. followers also say she predicted the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, warning a would descend on a big coast, covering people and towns and [causing] everything to disappear under the water. Back in 1989 she warned that the will be attacked by steel a possible reference to the Twin Tower attacks in 2001. She also warned that a group of Muslim extremists would invade Europe by 2016, foreseeing a Muslim that would be kick-started by the Arab Spring in 2010 and play out in Syria, eventually resulting in the establishment of a caliphate by 2043 with Rome at the center. According to The Mirror she claimed this invasion by Muslim across Europe would mean the continent would to by the end of the year. She specifically said: [Extremists] would use chemical warfare against Europeans. political predictions take on a new poignancy posthumously; could her assertions about the elusive 45th President equate to predicting an assassination attempt, or simply that Donald Trump is, as previously expected, a cyborg?

604|Koch Groups To Spend Nearly $1 Billion On 2016|WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Conservative political advocacy groups supported by the billionaire Koch brothers plan to spend $889 million in the 2016 U.S. elections, more than double what they raised in 2012, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The newspaper said the goal was announced to donors at a weekend meeting in Rancho Mirage, California, hosted by Freedom Partners, a business lobby at the center of the Koch brothers' political operation. The Post cited a person who attended the gathering. The money will be doled out by a network of 17 organizations funded by industrialists Charles and David Koch, who have become a major force in conservative politics in recent years, and other wealthy donors. The network raised $407 million for the 2012 campaign. During the 2012 election cycle, the national Republican Party collectively spent about $675 million, according to election data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The Post said the $889 million would be spent on field operations, technology, policy study and other expenses. The Freedom Partners network spent almost $300 million on November's congressional elections, in which Republicans won control of the Senate and retained their majority in the House of Representatives. The potential field for the Republican presidential nomination is fairly crowded and the Post said the Koch group was still considering whether it would support candidates in the Republican primaries, which could dramatically shape the campaign and possible lead to intraparty conflict. Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, all of whom are mentioned as possible presidential candidates, took part in the Rancho Mirage meeting, the Post said. The newspaper said the Freedom Partners network included Americans for Prosperity and funded groups such as Concerned Veterans for America, the Libre Initiative and Generation Opportunity.

6048|Media blackout as hundreds of black teens attack Temple U. students, police, a horse|Print In a story that predictably did not make the mainstream media, and with video surveillance very difficult to find, a massive mob of black teens viciously attacked white Temple University students, police officers and even a police horse in Philadelphia on Friday night. In the limited local coverage this story did receive, the race aspect was generally avoided. It is way past time to take back the media, and fill it with truth-tellers, not apologists. More than 150 teens, spread out in groups of 20 or 30, descended upon the campus at around 8:30 p.m. Friday wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing, according to NBC 10 But there is a reason for all of this horror, according to Solomon Jones of Philly.com . It evidently boils down to the progressive canard white privilege. The black teens are feeling excluded because evil white others have come into their neighborhood and built rental properties for college students, raising the property values of their neighborhoods in a way that evidently excludes the angry teens, who were used to having their blighted turf unmolested.|2022-09-21 13:00:00|FAKE|Amelia Rivera|World News Network|526033|91489|290|427|Mexico|English|2022-09-19 08:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|1558800|1749600|1114|4.833333333333333

Share on Twitter Print This Post The CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. Battleground tracker found that by a small margin letter made Democrats more likely (net +7) to support Clinton. In the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 48%-40%, North Carolina (48%-45%), and in Colorado (42%-39%). The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona (44%-42%). According to CBS News , And the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap slightly larger now than the last time in these states that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump. To put it another way, Hillary support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. These are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. Republicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. If the Comey letter is the big October surprise, it working on voters.

6088|FEAR OF TRUMP: BUSH, OBAMA, CLINTON ALL BUYING PROPERTY IN NON-EXTRADITION NATIONS|Email It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has.|2022-10-01 16:00:00|FAKE|Zoe Lee|City Beat|741449|7836|0|5279|Myanmar|English|2022-09-29 02:00:00|Crítica|1|True|2624400|2401200|2193|0.0

6098|Biden Doesn't Stand a Chance. Clinton's Secretary of State Will Be Vicky Nuland - Daniel Larison|Taming the corporate media beast Biden Doesn't Stand a Chance. Clinton's Secretary of State Will Be Vicky Nuland Originally appeared at The American Conservative Joe Biden is reportedly being considered for Secretary of State in a Clinton administration: Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. If Biden is on such a list, I doubt he is at the top of it, and my guess is that he be the nominee in any case. There are other likely choices, including Victoria Nuland, that would be a better fit with Clinton and would be even more likely to share her foreign policy priorities. Kelley Vlahos reported earlier this year on record: Where will Victoria Nuland be after January? Nuland is one of Hillary protégés at the State Department, and she is also greatly admired by hardline Republicans. This suggests she would be easily approved by Congress as secretary of state or maybe even national-security in turn suggests that her foreign-policy views deserve a closer look. If Nuland can be considered a Clinton protege, Biden is more of a rival. During the first Obama term, Biden and Clinton were frequently on opposing sides of internal foreign policy debates, and in his 2015 announcement that he run for president Biden offered what I took to be a rebuke of more aggressive foreign policy positioning: We have to accept the fact that we solve all of the problems. We solve many of them alone. The argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things good enough. not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons and lives on the line, put them at risk. Probably their most significant disagreement was over intervention in Libya: Clinton was a major supporter, and Biden saw no compelling reason for the U.S. to intervene. Biden has a fairly hawkish record over the last twenty years, but even he see why the U.S. should get involved there. As recently as June, he was publicly claiming vindication for opposing an intervention that Clinton touts as smart power at its best. I see why she would want Biden as her Secretary of State, and I definitely see why he would want to serve in her administration.|2022-10-06 00:00:00|FAKE|Nora Patel|The Observer|872865|22722|269|4696|Russia|English|2022-09-13 04:00:00|Reportaje|0|True|1026000|2998800|2283|4.483333333333333

But it says a lot about the lasting power of Viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventy-year-olds on the ballot. ( For an election lasting more than four years, please call your doctor .) In last newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman (I have lost track) to come forward to say that Donald Trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago. The woman in question is Jessica Drake, who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament, she was working in the the adult industry what People Magazine calls porn) for Wicked Pictures (the 20th Century Fox of gang banging) when the randy Donald kissed and hugged her in his room. Trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door, together with two friends. Normally, in the adult business, when three porn stars knock on your hotel door, considered foreplay. When effusive greeting of Miss Drake did not lead to more snuggling, let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television, he offered her $10,000 to satisfy his suite dreams.

6105|A Trump Supporter Just Held Six Children At Gunpoint For Dumbest Reason Ever|Comments From Hillary Clinton on the electric chair to African-American effigies hung from trees , Trump supporters are clearly very passionate about their lawn displays. Add to the list a 56 year-old Michigan Man who is now facing felony weapons charges after holding six children ages 12 to 14 at gunpoint and forcing them to the ground for allegedly knocking down his Trump yard sign. right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. Michael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had his Trump sign, although he actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek pulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a lawn. In any case, it appears that the consisted in the sign simply being knocked down perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind and the children were reportedly traumatized by the experience. When police, who were called to the scene by mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek standing over them yelling and cursing. The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using very profane language. According to local news channel Fox 2, the kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them. Kubek claims he felt threatened because he was outnumbered by the adolescents and invoked his second amendment right. Luckily, he was arrested by local police and had his gun confiscated although he has now been released on a $5,000 bail. Just another day in America, folks.

6109|Donald Trump’s Nightmare Comes True 10 Days Before Election – This Could Ruin EVERYTHING!|0 comments With just 10 days to go before the most important election of our lifetime, Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are soaring in the polls. The Friday announcement that the FBI would be re-opening its investigation into Hillary personal email server has not helped matters for Democrats, either. But none of this will matter if they are able to manipulate the vote. According to MRC Blog , why the left is going to drastic measures to drum up Democratic voters, expanding voting rights to include non-citizens in major cities nationwide. The latest notable city to do so is San Francisco, whose Election Day ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the public schools to vote in school board elections. Under this measure, people with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all would be allowed to vote. San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, who believes illegal aliens should be allowed to vote to bypass the broken immigration system in this country, made the following statement: One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and have a voice. had legal immigrants had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say. Chiu is the son of Taiwanese immigrants. It is no secret that the vast majority of illegal aliens vote Democrat, because that is the party which is incessantly trying to buy their loyalty with an endless stream of handouts and promises of blanket amnesty. If it so, we see all of these liberals pushing so hard to give illegals voting rights; they simply do so because it works in their favor, not because it is actually good for anyone. Major cities from sea to shining sea are following San lead, which is just one more very important reason to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. We need to turn this country around and FAST!|2022-09-11 15:00:00|FAKE|Jacob Gupta|Central Times|853539|94810|572|726|Turkey|English|2022-09-03 03:00:00|Editorial|0|True|892800|158400|1902|9.533333333333333

6111|Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy|"Home | World | Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy By Anzu Legion 03/11/2016 13:41:13 LONDON England Britain is no longer a sovereign democratic nation when 17.5 million people who voted for Brexit can be swept aside with illegal injunctions. When Britain is being ruled by those who wish harm upon these shores from foreign nations, and pander to other nations to invade, then there is no reason to believe that we are living in a democratic sovereign nation. This is the case when 17.5 million people voted on June 23 to leave the European Union, only to be overstepped by a few treasonous vipers who misled the High Court possibly due to corruption at the highest levels of the system. The EU referendum was a legally bound vote with promises from the political establishment that the result would be respected. To have the wrath of 17.5 million people on you will not be a nice thing, it will not be pleasant because the people never forget, and the coming election will result in some major changes. We are currently embroiled within a constitutional crisis, where the will of the people is being superseded by a few litigational scum bags who do not realise the enormity of their decision to thwart the will of the people. Boycott You have condemned all members of parliament who supported Remain to unemployment. You will never be voted in again, including Theresa May who shoehorned herself into the role of prime minister. Guyanese Gina Miller, who was instrumental in this decision is not even British, she is some investment banker cunt with no mandate to thwart the EU referendum. As for the judges involved, you have no right to undermine the will of the people. It is most certainly a question of corruption at the highest levels where these supposed upholders of law, are working against the law and undermining democracy and sovereign rights. 17.5 million people voted for Brexit and 17.5 million people will have their say in 2020 when the right people will be put in charge. The people never forget."|2022-09-16 05:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Echo News|315988|63563|109|4822|France|English|2022-09-05 07:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1288800|345600|2061|1.8166666666666667
6116|Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins|Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016 While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported. Charlie Spiering wrote: He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart, Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges the challenge posed by slavery and we fought a civil war, she said. She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together, she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I think so, she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. A post at Barracuda Brigade observed: Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of hope and change when in fact it is just more of the same. Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing. Still, we have to ask was hint a warning or a threat?

While many around the world had presumed Democracy would continue in its current position as the dominant political ideology in the West despite a change in management, it is thought its growing unpopularity amongst sections of the US electorate has seen it make the decision to vacate its profession entirely. You have to know when it is time to hang up your hat, and you guys seem quite fond of the man who pay income tax and insults war veterans and war families, the descendent of Cleisthenes stated. Many political experts have speculated that democracy has retired preemptively as it believes president elect Donald Trump will seek to have it deported, owing to the fact that Democracy emigrated from mainland Europe via Greece some years ago. Democracy has a number of international franchises which may be wound down in the coming years too. I think a lot of people are really, really angry with me, so the time to step aside has come. When people question your ability and purpose, you begin to make for the exit sign, Democracy confirmed. Despite stating its intention to leave, Democracy is required to give at least 6-months notice, have a hand in training in its successor, All Out Chaos, and going through an awkward exit interview which will see it field questions from over 57 million people who vote for this.|2022-10-06 03:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Herald Tribune|469600|36712|401|4496|Japan|English|2022-09-08 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3009600|655200|1699|6.683333333333334

6142|BREAKING: Trump VP Plane Slides Off Runway at LaGuardia Airport in NYC!|0 comments GOP VP candidate Mike Trump plane slid off the runway at LaGuardia airport Thursday evening, landing in the mud not far from the East River. The Trump plane stopped in the mud. It broke through a thin veneer of concrete designed to give way to keep planes from sliding into the river. No one was injured in the incident. Authorities say there could have been fatalities had the plane ended up in the water. KTLA 5 reports : Rescue crews were responding to the scene. The incident took place during a rainy night in the city. The press pool in the back of the aircraft could feel the plane fishtailing as it touched down and sliding off the runway before coming to a very sharp halt in the grass off the side of the runway. We could feel the plane moving, and it was just not a natural landing that you experience, Elizabeth Landers, who was on the plane, told Erin Burnett on OutFront. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Donald campaign, said the businessman called Pence shortly after the incident, adding that Trump is very glad everyone on-board the plane is safe. There was some noticeable damage to the runway. A campaign spokesperson told reporters there was no structural damage to the plane. Landers said the Indiana trip to New York had initially been delayed due to inclement weather. His plane was kept in a ground hold at the airport in Fort Dodge, Iowa, earlier in the day. Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation, explained to Anderson Cooper that the weather likely prevented the plane from getting good traction. There were 37 people on board at the time of the accident, including Pence. This could have been tragic. It is exponentially safer to fly in a plane than it is to ride in a car, but accidents still happen. Thank God all are safe.|2022-10-06 03:00:00|FAKE|Caleb Shah|National Courier|200358|34701|291|6158|Algeria|English|2022-09-18 12:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|0|True|3009600|1486800|1809|4.85
6146|Hillary is So Unpopular, She Has to Pay Off Youth Voters and Fabricate Her Rallies|Posted on October 30, 2016 by Tim Brown Among the many Wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer, it was clear that Hillary Clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe. In fact, it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her. The Gateway Pundit reported : the astroturfed candidate. Hillary is SOOO unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies. 5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks WikiLeak Wikileaks released nearly 20,000 hacked emails it says are from the accounts of Democratic National Committee officials on Friday. The emails are devastating for Hillary Clinton. According to at least one hacked email Hillary Clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online. She also pays millennials to show up at her rallies. support is all a lie. all astroturfed. Everything this woman does is all a lie even her rallies are fabricated. If explanation were not enough, how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about Donald Trump. 5 Biggest Scoops from the #DNCLeaks Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) July 23, 2016 This should have come as no surprise. If you remember when her campaign kicked off in 2015, I reported on the fact that more than 50% of her Twitter followers were either completely fake or inactive . Additionally, when she had her Iowa kickoff event, a whopping 22 people showed up . The majority of those were reporters! Hillary Clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid anti-American liberals, and even then, it looks like having to pay them to actually do anything to support her. In other words, her candidacy is completely contrived.

He will be deported from Norway. The police informed Petrovskiy that he has two days to get a flight ticket and five to leave the country. The police wanted to see passport and know if he accepts the decision and leaves Norway voluntarily or if he has to be forced. Petrovskiy answered that according to the advice of his lawyer, Nils Christian Nordhus, he keep the passport in his apartment, and he will talk with his lawyer before giving an answer concerning his departure. After this Petrovskiy attempted to call his lawyer while the police were waiting, but because his lawyer pick it up, the police decided to arrest Petrovskiy and search apartment. Petrovskiy has lived in the address for some time and has been registered as a Norwegian resident. The real reason behind the search was to acquire passport, as without it he cannot be deported. Despite the efforts of the police, the passport was not uncovered. The decision about the deportation was made by the Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet) after the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) sent a letter to the directorate.

One year ago, we all that that Donald Trump was just being funny, just being Trump, when he said that Hillary Clinton was showing poor judgement in letting Huma Abedin, wife of perf sleaze Anthony Weiner have access to government information. Trump called the couple a security risk, but again, we thought he was just making fun of them. As it turns out, Donald words were eerily prophetic. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard by now that the FBI is reopening the investigation of Hillary email problems after finding evidence on devices at Anthony home. Earlier, we reported that FBI Director James Comey had tricked Department of Justice and the Clintons in sending the investigation announcement letter to Congress. Some believe that Comey was attempting to force the DOJ to issue a warrant so that his agents can start reading the 10,000+ emails on device. Here Is How FBI Director Comey BAMBOOZLED The DOJ, CONGRESS, And The CLINTONS All At Once Now, Anthony Weiner has spoken and he may have made job even easier, while completely bypassing the Department of Justice altogether. According to reports, Weiner has given permission for the FBI to access all of the information on his electronic devices, including his wifi router. . @BretBaier emails Chris Wallace while on air: Weiner has given FBI permission to search computer so no warrant needed. @FoxNewsSunday Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 30, 2016 I emailed that 2 sources say Weiner is cooperating w/ FBI- & co-owned laptop. Also NY FBI had info 4 a few weeks- pressure was building Bret Baier (@BretBaier) October 30, 2016 In essence, Weiner is singing like a bird, and the FBI can conduct a thorough review of the emails in question. If there is criminality found on devices, they have a shot at it. Is there anything that the Department of Justice or the Clintons can do? Time will tell, but many believe that WikiLeaks and others are about to drop more incriminating evidence on Hillary later this week. Comey may have saved himself. Weiner may be trying to cut a plea deal to save himself. Hang on, as this ride is still picking up steam!

6161|Trump: Israel is a ray of hope to the world|November 11, 2016 Trump: Israel is a ray of hope to the world Just two days after his stunning election victory, President-elect Donald Trump delivered a message to Israel, describing his personal affection for the Jewish state and hopes that his administration will be able to strengthen ties strained by eight years of tense relations between Israel and the Obama administration. Calling Israel a ray of hope, Trump released the statement to the Israel HaYom newspaper, which is owned by prominent Jewish Republican donor, Sheldon Adelson. Adelson backed Trump in this election towards the end of the race, giving tens of millions of dollars to the Trump campaign and pro-Trump political action committees. I love and respect Israel and its citizens, wrote Trump. Israel and the US share so many common values, like free speech, freedom of worship, and the special emphasis on creating opportunities for all citizens to fulfill their dreams.

6165|New Leaked Clinton Emails Came from the Devices of Anthony Weiner|New Leaked Clinton Emails Came from the Devices of Anthony Weiner 6 shares by Dean Daniels / October 28, 2016 / POLITICS / On Friday, the FBI announced an investigation into newly leaked emails linked to Hillary Clinton. In a surprising twist, the new leaked emails from the private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. confiscated electronic devices belonging to top aide Huma Abedin, her controversial and perverted husband, Anthony Weiner. Officially, the federal law enforcement agents are opening an investigation into Weiner texting a 15-year-old in North Carolina. And according to Director Comey, the F.B.I. were taking steps to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. Shortly after the announcement, Donald Trump utilized the situation to advantage and running theme of corruption at a rally in New Hampshire. Supporters nearly cheered in complete unison: lock her up. Hillary corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office, said Trump to the roaring crowd. I have great respect for the fact that the F.B.I. and the D.O.J. are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made, Mr. Trump said, referring also to the Department of Justice. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand. It is hope that it is about to be corrected. The decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary secret email server just 11 days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be, Reince Priebus, the Republican committee chairman, said in a statement. This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.

The move came after news broke over the weekend that the Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen. Some of the payments were made by mistake, others were taken fraudulently. While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not, Carter said in a statement. About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments. As first reported by the Los Angeles Times , the Pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost 10,000 California Guard soldiers. The paper reported that many of the soldiers affected had served multiple combat deployments and had been ordered to repay bonuses plus interest. Some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay. The bonus scandal was revealed after audits showed widespread overpayments.|2022-10-06 22:00:00|FAKE|Isabella Nguyen|National Courier|759795|10847|323|5816|France|English|2022-09-04 16:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|3078000|291600|1243|5.383333333333334

I felt like it was pretty clear that I should be mad at Trump for what he said on that bus and at Hillary for telling Wall Street completely different things than she was telling us.

In addition to potentially dangerous levels of phytoestrogens, it contains exceptionally high levels of chemicals that bind to the nutrients in the bean, preventing their absorption. Soy derivatives such as soy protein are even worse, as they are isolated from the rest of the nutrients in the bean and have usually been extracted with toxic chemicals.Traditional cultures developed two major ways to bypass this problem: fermentation and curdling. Both are ancient techniques for changing the fundamental nutritional makeup of foods. These processes are what transform soy (the dangerous food) into the healthful products of tofu, tempeh, miso and soy sauce that have played a major role in the diets of many Asian cultures for hundreds of years.

There are many factors that point to the existence of institutional racism with German law enforcement agencies.

6196|BREAKING! — Hillary Clinton looks like a goner!|Wikileaks Just Released Her Full Isis Donor List With Names! WikiLeaks just finished the job that started few months ago! Hillary just got killed! She is not going to survive this! too much! Pure treason! According to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Citing the need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets, said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country. Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when largest donations come from those two countries. In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 birthday check. The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would welcome the Clinton suggestions for investments in Haiti particularly on education and health. Desai added that while Qatar had already allocated most of their $20 million they were happy to consider projects we suggest. Like this?

Fox News host Megyn Kelly was no exception, recently asking former House Speaker and Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich if the allegations could be a reason for him falling behind in the polls. Gingrich snapped and explained that he was sick of people like Kelly using inflammatory language. He then argued that her asking him about the issue proves she's fascinated with sex: You wanna go back through the tapes of your show recently? You are fascinated with sex and you care about public policy! what I get out of watching you tonight! At a Trump event in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, an MSNBC reporter asked Gingrich what he would say to Republican women who were upset by his remarks in Kelly's interview, according to the Blaze . Gingrich had a pretty insightful response: had a lot of Republican women write me and thank me for standing up to the baloney that is thrown at us by people who excuse Bill Clinton ignore Bill Clinton and then explain to us how shocked they are by Donald Trump."" However, not all Republican women are standing by their party. Katie Packer, a deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney in 2012, told the Washington Post the GOP has a lot to make up for after Election Day: For next-generation professional women, the party is going to have to do something very, very drastic to change the course of where this candidate has taken us. I think the leaders in our party are going to have to aggressively reject this. Come November 9, they better be prepared to make very strong statements condemning all of behavior. A recent Fox News poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by three points among likely voters."|2022-09-16 11:00:00|FAKE|Lucas Kim|Morning Star|333024|94259|403|5987|Algeria|English|2022-09-13 16:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1310400|1069200|1874|6.716666666666667

6215|U.S. Special Forces Join Fight For Mosul|We Are Change Fierce battle for the city of Mosul continues to shock Iraq and the whole Middle East with no significant results. The leading role belongs to the assault of the Iraqi army and Kurdish Self-Defense still lack experience and capture the city in the shortest time. However, 500 elite commandos of the U.S. Special Forces, which had been transferred this week at Mosul should give new impetus to the assault. U.S. combatants are supported by Apache and Chinook helicopters. According to the Inside Syria Media Center , the U.S. Special Forces are located at the forefront of Iraqi and Kurdish combat formations. Military experts believe these combat conditions are atypical for the special operation forces which are aimed to carry out reconnaissance and other specific tasks. Elite combatants in Mosul actually perform the functions of infantry soldiers, resulting in inevitable great losses, which are going to be covered up and silenced by the Washington officials in the usual manner. Although the U.S. officials have repeatedly stated Mosul should be liberated from terrorists to eliminate the Islamic State, the decision to use U.S. Special Forces looks unjustified at first glance. However, the protracted nature of the assault on the city is forcing the Pentagon to take extreme measures to complete the operation before the U.S. presidential election. Therefore, the White House uses this situation, first of all, as a large-scale PR-campaign to support the candidate of the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton. In this context, it becomes clear why the U.S. Government refrained from active struggle against terrorists for so long choosing an opportune moment strangely coincided with the end of the presidential elections in the United States. Liberation of Mosul should also demonstrate to the world community the importance and crucial role of the American nation in the fight against the Islamic State. It is even more regrettable in the light of the recent revelations, which confirmed the United States and American role in the creation and funding of the Islamic State terrorists.

Kane had been found guilty of criminal conspiracy and perjury in a case stemming from the abuse of her office. sentencing hearing was held Monday, where Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy sentenced the former attorney general to 10 to 23 months in prison. In 2012, Kane was elected Attorney General of Pennsylvania with the help of a $250,000 Bloomberg-funded ad campaign against her opponent. Even before assuming office, Attorney General-elect Kane attacked the Right-to-Carry by signing a letter opposing federal reciprocity legislation. Kane would go on to attack Right-to-Carry reciprocity again, unilaterally and illegitimately eliminating recognition of non-resident Florida Concealed Weapon Licenses. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer , at the sentencing hearing, Demchick-Alloy admonished Kane for her conduct in leaking confidential grand jury materials as part of an attack on a political rival. Demchick-Alloy stated, The case is about ego, ego of a politician consumed by her image from Day And instead of focusing solely on the business of fighting crime, the focus was battling these perceived enemies and utilizing and exploiting her position to do it. A colleague that testified at the hearing described office by stating, through a pattern of systematic firings and Nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office. In seeking a lenient sentence for his client, attorney cited the consequences the convicted criminal had already suffered, telling the court, She stands a convicted felon subject to public shame and public humiliation. Further, the attorney argued that prison was a risk to safety. According to the Inquirer, Demchick-Alloy appeared unimpressed, noting, When you unfortunately dirty yourself with criminal behavior, you assume that risk. Kane had faced a potential 12 to 24 years in prison for her crimes. Though Demchick-Alloy imposed only a fraction of the maximum sentence, punishment should be enough to prevent her from obtaining a position where she could torment her political adversaries, or Keystone State gun owners.

And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of stupid hats and a Deplorables T-shirt to vote. Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules apply to them. Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other, local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how going to vote and so nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful. the video via KTVT . Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

Johnson & Johnson has lost its third lawsuit alleging that the pharmaceutical baby powder causes ovarian cancer. Jurors in St. Louis awarded Deborah Giannecchini $70 million late Thursday, according to Bloomberg . For 40 years, Giannecchini, 62, had used the talcum powder for feminine hygiene, but stopped when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three years ago. Now her lawyers say Giannecchini has an 80% chance of dying in the next two years, despite having undergone extensive treatment. Carol Goodrich, a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson, says the company will appeal to the decision . We deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer, she said. We will appeal verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Baby Powder. Additionally, research into the link between talc and cancer have been been mixed or inconclusive, according to the American Cancer Society . That likely factored into a New Jersey decision to throw out two lawsuits against Johnson in Johnson in September, which alleged that the talcum powder had caused their ovarian cancer.

6243|Putin's New Promise: 'I WILL DEFEAT THE ILLUMINATI'|The Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown that he has never been afraid of fighting several opponents on different fronts. Now, it appears that he has a new target in his sights the Illuminati. Vladimir Putin swears to take on the Illuminati It has been previously alleged that Putin, who was born and raised in the shadow of important political influence and who previously served in the notorious Russian intelligence agency, the KGB is himself a bona fide member of the New World Order. However, it seems unlikely that Putin ever became a fully-fledged member of the Illuminati. From the outset of his rise to power, Putin has made it clear that he is a Russian patriot and that his first duty will always be to his country. To this end, Putin has been seen to actively act against the interests of those within the Illuminati if their activities conflict with the health and prosperity of the Russian nation. This has allegedly led to Jacob Rothschild calling Putin traitor to the New World Order.' In response, it has been claimed that Putin said that he would destroy the shadowy organization. It is believed that Putin has now established himself as the most dangerous opponent of the Illuminati alive today . Over the years, Putin has forced out some oligarchs in the pay of the Khazarian Mafia out of the country and into areas such as the City of London. It is claimed that he has done this to loosen the stranglehold that the Illuminati have held over the Russian economy and major industries since the end of the Cold War. He has also expelled all businesses operating under the Rothschild Banking Group in recent months as he believed that they were playing a positive role in the Russian financial system. WATCH THE VIDEO: It has also been alleged that Putin is moving outside of the realm of domestic concerns and is also thwarting Illuminati operations on the global scale. It has been said that the Russian intervention in Syria and commitment to protecting the ruling party headed by President Al-Assad has torpedoed Illuminati plans to lay a pipeline through the country which would have been operated by their agents.

There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. In a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly fact-check the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. Mitchell refused to accept reality: Just a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, no criminality. She fretted: I don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context. The context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. But as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality.

The rumored second round of layoffs at Twitter which in 2011 was granted by the befuddled city of San Francisco the Twitter tax break on employment taxes comes at a very inopportune moment for the glory of commercial real estate. These layoffs would amount to 8% to workforce, or about 300 people, according to Bloomberg.Already, Twitter has thrown 183,642 square feet of vacant office space at its two-building Mid-Market headquarters on the sublease market, thus bringing it to 1.51 million square feet (msf).This comes at a time when, according to the snapshot from Cushman & Wakefield, leasing activity nearly ground to a halt in the third quarter, with only 875,000 sf leased the lowest since 2001!There was only one major lease deal over 100,000 sf: live streaming video platform Twitch, which took 178,000 sf. The next largest deal was less than half that size: WeWork leased 78,000 sf.Leasing activity for the three quarters this year plunged 30% from the same period last year, to just 4.7 msf, according to a report released this week by commercial real estate services firm Savills Studley, which added dryly, The competition for space has calmed dramatically from several quarters ago.And there is a lot of new supply coming on the market, according to Cushman & Wakefield: currently, 3.8 msf of office space are under construction, with 31% preleased.Overall vacancy rose 0.7 percentage points from the prior quarter to 9.0% in Q3, according to Savills Studley.

626|Donald Trump Is Changing His Campaign Slogan to Prove He’s Not Racist|After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to make America great again, Trump now says adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is. You know, I have the theme America great and I've added a couple of things, Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. Right now adding make America great adding because really going to be for everyone. not going to be for a group of people, going to be for everyone. true. The allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called statement the textbook definition of a racist comment. Trump, who apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.

6262|Republican Lawmaker Secretly Recorded Fantasizing To Gun Group About Shooting Hillary (AUDIO)|Republicans just quit fantasizing about doing bodily harm to Hillary Clinton. Over the weekend, Sen. Richard Burr noticed a picture of Clinton hanging in a gun shop and decided the owners should put a bullseye on it. Speaking to GOP volunteers on Saturday , Burr joked that he had recently visited a gun shop and nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifleswith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it. I was a little bit shocked at that it have a bullseye on it, Burr told the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, an army of support out there right now for our candidates. comments echo those of his presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has called on the Second Amendment people to do something about his Democratic opponent. However, Burr is at least pretending that he feels bad about his remarks. The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman issued an apology on Monday. The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it, Burr said. A Burr campaign official said the remark about feeling better had nothing at all to do with the idea of Clinton being shot. Really. He was just referring to the support other right-wing candidates have gotten from various gun rights groups. Honest. Burr also said that if he is re-elected and Hillary should happen to win the White House, he will do all he can to continue obstructing the appointment of a ninth Supreme Court justice. When asked about the possibility of Merrick Garland, President nominee, being appointed, Burr said, it going to happen period. And if Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court. Burr also made it clear that he considers being responsible for the longest judicial vacancy in history a badge of honor.

Via YourNewsWire The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in New Jersey and aims to silence claim that the election is rigged, which the DNC are particularly sensitive about. The DNC alleges that the RNC has not done enough to reprimand Trump for claiming that the election is rigged, and seeks to have the court hold the committee in civil contempt as well as levy sanctions. The DNC claims that because the RNC has done ballot security work, they are agreeing with Trump that the election is rigged. Marc Elias, Hillary campaign counsel, claims that there is also a racial element to claims of voter fraud. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in or of key states, the Democratic attorneys, including Hillary Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias, wrote.

(Photo by AFP) A new report has revealed that the number of Palestinian homes demolished by Israeli authorities in the largest division of the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the current year stands at more than 700. Israel's Hebrew-language Haaretz newspaper reported on Friday that a total of 780 Palestinian homes have been demolished in Area C of the West Bank, which constitutes about 61 percent of the territory and is under full Israeli military control, since January, leaving 1,129 people homeless. That compares to 453 demolitions in the area last year, which left 580 Palestinians without any place of residence. The newspaper noted that a total of 125 Palestinian homes have also been destroyed in East Jerusalem al-Quds since the start of the year, up from 78 last year. The demolitions affected 164 Palestinians in the region, marking an increase from 108 the previous year. The revelations came only two days after Israeli military forces razed three Palestinian homes in the Beit Hanina and Silwan neighborhoods of East Jerusalem al-Quds, displacing at least 44 people, including minors. International bodies and rights groups argue that sustained demolitions of Palestinian homes and structures in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds are an attempt by the Tel Aviv regime to uproot Palestinians from their native territories, and confiscate more land for expansion of illegal settlements. More than half a million Israelis live in over 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds. The presence and continued expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian lands have created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian Authority wants the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinians state, with East Jerusalem al-Quds as its capital.

The room full of Second Amendment fanatics panicked when one of fans yelled gun! and Trump was rushed from the stage. Immediately, campaign began spinning the lie that this man had intended to assassinate Trump. In fact, all he was armed with was a poster saying Republicans Against Trump. The whole incident was over nothing. But it stop fans from pretending this proved Trump was a profile in courage.

He was released shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, there is an example of a candidate staring down a scary situation and not blinking. Hillary Clinton.

6270|Supreme Court Rules Priests DO NOT Have to Report Child Abuse|In a highly controversial decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that Catholic priests are not mandatory reporters of child abuse they are made privy to as a result of administering sacramental confessions. According to Patheos , the ruling references article 609 A(1) of the Louisiana Code: With respect to mandatory reporters: Notwithstanding any claim of privileged communication, any mandatory reporter who has cause to believe that a physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect was a contributing factor in a death shall report in accordance with Article 610. The Oct. 28 ruling states in part: any communication made to a priest privately in the sacrament of confession for the purpose of confession, repentance, and absolution is a confidential communication under La. Code Evid. 511, and the priest is exempt from mandatory reporter status in such circumstances by operation of La. Child. Code art. 603, because under the tenets of the [Roman Catholic] church he has an inviolable duty to keep such communications confidential. The case which originally brought this issue before the court was that of a young woman who told a Baton Rouge-area Catholic priest that a longtime parishioner had sexually assaulted her when she was 14-years-old. The priest in turn did not report the abuse.

This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they like. Plain and simple. Share on Twitter Print This Post On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G . This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they like. Plain and simple. At issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. Last summer, the court granted the school request to put a lower court ruling in the favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. The Virginia school board established a policy mirroring bathroom police laws in red states like North Carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. In this case, the district court ruled against G.G. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide separate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. In January 2015, the Department of Office of Civil Rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a school must treat transgender students in a manner consistent with their gender identity. Because of that letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of G.G. It relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that courts generally should defer to an interpretation of its own regulation. In reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. First, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, POC and members of the LGBT community. Second, the right wing is hoping to weaken Federal Agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations.|2022-10-08 15:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Global Gazette|219982|2689|26|1340|Indonesia|English|2022-09-06 08:00:00|Análisis|0|True|3225600|435600|2340|0.43333333333333335

6300|"Scientists Leak Evidence That Approve Elon Musk's Theory: The Universe Is A ""Computer"" Simulation"|Share on Facebook Physicists say they may have evidence that the universe is a computer simulation. How? They made a computer simulation of the universe. And it looks sort of like us. A long-proposed thought experiment, put forward by both philosophers and popular culture, points out that any civilization of sufficient size and intelligence would eventually create a simulation universe if such a thing were possible. A long-proposed thought experiment, put forward by both philosophers and popular culture, points out that any civilization of sufficient size and intelligence would eventually create a simulation universe if such a thing were possible. And since there would therefore be many more simulations (within simulations, within simulations) than real universes, it is therefore more likely than not that our world is artificial. Now a team of researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany led by Silas Beane say they have evidence this may be true. In a paper named Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation they point out that current simulations of the universe which do exist, but which are extremely weak and small naturally put limits on physical laws. Technology Review explains that the problem with all simulations is that the laws of physics, which appear continuous, have to be superimposed onto a discrete three dimensional lattice which advances in steps of time. What that basically means is that by just being a simulation, the computer would put limits on, for instance, the energy that particles can have within the program. These limits would be experienced by those living within the sim and as it turns out, something which looks just like these limits do in fact exist. For instance, something known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin, or GZK cut off, is an apparent boundary of the energy that cosmic ray particles can have. This is caused by interaction with cosmic background radiation. But Beane and paper argues that the pattern of this rule mirrors what you might expect from a computer simulation . Naturally, at this point the science becomes pretty tricky to wade through and we would advise you read the paper itself to try and get the full detail of the idea. But the basic impression is an intriguing one. Like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell, we may never be able to see the of our prison but through physics we may be able to reach out and touch them.

6334|"BREAKING: DOJ FINALLY Secures Warrant To Inspect Huma’s Emails | Daily Wire"|BREAKING: DOJ FINALLY Secures Warrant To Inspect Emails By: Michael Qazvini October 30, 2016 On the heels of FBI Director James unexpected Friday announcement about revisiting the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the US Department of Justice has officially obtained a warrant to inspect Huma stash of emails. Abedin is perhaps Hillary closest confidante. During the course of the investigation, she spoke with federal agents on several occasions, evading questions and providing only vague answers to direct inquiries. The process has begun, stated the bureau Sunday in a rather cryptic message, suggesting that emails will be possibly be examined before election day. Enjoying intimate access to the former secretary of state, Abedin sent several emails through private server. A few months ago, the FBI explicitly asked Abedin to hand over any information, including emails and devices those emails may be stored in to investigators. It now looks like she failed to comply with the request. In a bizarre twist of events, the FBI found hundreds of thousands of emails stored on a laptop belonging to her now-estranged husband. The emails were discovered as investigators seized evidence related to a separate investigation regarding an inquiry into disgraced Congressman Anthony possible sexual overtures to a minor. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chats with her staff, including aide Huma Abedin (L), onboard her plane in White Plains, New York, October 22, 2016, on her way to a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. / AFP / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) Law enforcement officials have been hesitant to provide a timeline to the public for when the completion of its review of this treasure trove of emails. There may be evidence hiding in those emails that could incriminate boss, US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But we likely find out until after the election, raising unsettling questions about the integrity of our fragile democracy. As a matter of principle, the FBI should tell the American people everything it knows before voters cast their ballots on November 8th.

6349|Russia Extends Aleppo Ceasefire Through Friday, Urges Rebels to Leave|Rebels: Leaving Aleppo 'Completely Out of the Question' by Jason Ditz, November 02, 2016 Share This Some two weeks after initially announcing what was going to be an eight hour ceasefire in Aleppo, Russia has continued to hold their fire, and today announced an extension of the operation through Friday , calling on the rebels to take the opportunity to withdraw from the city. While on the one hand this marks an extension of the ceasefire, the Friday deadline may amount to government announcing an upcoming end to the pause. This comes a day after Russian officials warned the rebel offensives around Aleppo were jeopardizing the ceasefire, and a few days after Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected a call from the Defense Ministry to resume strikes. The rebels fighting in Aleppo have rejected call to withdraw from the city by Friday evening as completely out of the question , insisting they intend to remain in the city to prevent allowing it to fall into the hands of the Russian military. Of course, involvement has only been airstrikes in Aleppo, with the fighting on the ground all between the Nusra Front-led rebels and the Syrian military. The military has been seen to have a major advantage recently, though a rebel offensive over the weekend may have turned the tables, and is likely to reason why there is growing pressure from Defense Ministry to resume the airstrikes. Russia has promised two corridors through which rebels can leave the city, and said they will allow them to take their weapons with them. The offer is similar to deals wherein rebel factions withdrew from small suburbs around Damascus, but of course on a much grander scale. That the rebels have already rejected it, however, suggests they believe they are not defeated yet.

635|Elizabeth Warren Backs Hillary Clinton|"Warren, a hero of progressive Democrats, is the latest party leader to fall in line behind Clinton after she clinched the requisite number of delegates earlier this week over rival Bernie Sanders. Warren told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow tonight, ""I am ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States, and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets anyplace close to the White House."" The endorsement comes the same day that President Obama also endorsed Clinton in a video and announced he would campaign with his former 2008 rival next week. But Warren's backing may be more politically important for Clinton than Obama's blessing. The Democratic senator, who remained neutral throughout the contest, championed many of the same economic inequality issues and Wall Street reforms Sanders drew attention to in the primary. She said tonight the 2016 election ""is not about one candidate, it's about all of us coming together coming together to fight to level the [economic] playing field."" In fact, she was urged by many progressive groups early on to challenge Clinton herself, and the ""Ready for Warren"" organization who tried to lay the groundwork for her run ended up endorsing Sanders. Even though she remained on the sidelines, Warren has emerged as a fierce attack dog against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, calling him a ""nasty, thin-skinned fraud"" just Thursday. He, in return, has derided her as ""Pocahontas"" an allusion to a controversy that emerged during her 2012 Senate run after she had claimed Native American ancestry. Tonight Warren said Trump had cheered for the 2007 economic crisis because he knew how to make a profit from it. ""What kind of a person does that?"" she asked, ""an insecure money-grubber who cares about nothing but himself. ... That cannot be the man who leads the United States of America."" Warren has been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for Clinton, a choice that could help allay some concerns among progressives about the former secretary of state's nomination. But there was immediate backlash online to Warren's anticipated nomination. Many supporters took to her Facebook page with profane comments, calling her a ""sell out"" for not endorsing Sanders."|2022-10-08 20:00:00|REAL|Gabriel Santos|City Beat|287572|97561|176|472|Philippines|English|2022-10-07 20:00:00|Editorial|1|True|3157200|3243600|2277|2.933333333333333

A new study finds the scariest part of the holiday may not be the costumes, but makeup for kids. Out of 48 makeup palettes, almost half contained toxic heavy metals. Nearly 20 percent of makeup palettes contain lead and cadmium, according to the newly published study by the Breast Cancer Fund. The study found that some products contained as many as four metals, including arsenic and chromium. Nine of the palettes were found to contain lead, a chemical that is unsafe at any level, for children particularly. Parents may have purchased and applied these products to their children unwittingly, as the makeup have to list ingredients on their labels. The BCF may have been among the first to test the palettes, as the FDA does not regulate this particular product. The FDA that regulates makeup does not have the power to require pre-market testing , Jen Coleman with the Oregon Environmental Council told KGW. The cosmetic safety law enacted 75 years ago does not require testing even for products marketed to children. While the FDA cannot do anything about the problem, they have issued guidelines to avoiding a rash, swollen eyelids, or other reaction this Halloween. The guidelines make no mention of potential heavy metal poisoning, but they do offer advice like Follow all directions carefully , and decorate your face with things that intended for your skin. a parent to do in the meantime?

The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body. The outrageous repudiation of the millennia-old bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history, he added. The annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes. Edelstein said the time has come for the international community to pass a resolution reaffirming Jerusalem as the holy city for the three major monotheistic religions, a city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of G-d was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets.

6406|Political Party of Anarchists, Libertarians, Hackers, and Computer Geeks to Take Power in Iceland|By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com In a country continuing to shirk the ordinary, Pirate Party an amalgamation of anarchists, libertarians, and hackers, who want to ban digital surveillance is predicted to win the national elections this Saturday. This collection of free-thinkers have upturned the traditional Western political paradigm and hopes to use online public polls to shape governmental policy and end all Internet spying. Although the Pirate Party formed just four years ago, its popularity has skyrocketed most likely for unconventional tactics aligning loosely with libertarianism the promotion of privacy rights and personal freedoms, and simultaneous shrinking of Big Government. Edward Snowden has been offered the safe haven of Icelandic citizenship should the Pirates likely victory come to fruition which makes sense, given the anti-establishment roots. In fact, the Pirates have experienced astonishing success in a short time taking the longstanding political traditionalists off-guard in the process even the founder, a programmer and former Wikileaks activist, is stunned. Asked whether she expected the explosion of enthusiasm for the nascent Pirate Party which now leads in public polls with 22.6 percent founder Birgitta Jónsdóttir decisively told the Washington Post , No way. But considering growing frustration with ever-increasing Western governments and all of the surveillance programs, police state tactics, and chill on personal liberties the rise of the Pirates, who describe themselves as neither right nor left but a radical mix of both, hardly seems too shocking. People want real changes and they understand that we have to change the systems, Jónsdóttir asserted, we have to modernize how we make laws. According to the website , The Icelandic Pirate Party was founded on November 24th, 2012 based on the political ideology of the Swedish Pirate Party, which Richard Falkvinge founded in January 2006, to bring about internet copyright reform.|2022-09-25 12:00:00|FAKE|Ethan Hayes|Capital Gazette|383903|62099|248|7865|Italy|English|2022-09-05 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2091600|334800|1995|4.133333333333334

Share on Twitter Print This Post Hopefully, as a country, return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare. But this year, when the man at the top of the Republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses, likely to be that time. On Wednesday, former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh, a right-wing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show, followed his lead and told urged his Twitter followers to grab their guns on Nov. 9 if Hillary Clinton is elected. Tweet: On November 8th, voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, grabbing my musket. You in? Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 This type of language from someone who used to be and thankfully no longer is a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. After all, not long ago Trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if Clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate Supreme Court judges. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks, the Republican nominee said. Although the Second Amendment people maybe there is, I know. More recently, Trump said that like to see what happens if bodyguards were disarmed. I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately, he said. Take their guns away, see what happens to her. Not only does rhetoric align perfectly with what Trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but also a continuation of dangerous language that the former Republican congressman seems to enjoy using. Earlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in Dallas, Walsh blamed President Obama, tweeting: This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you. Before Trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. Now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee. On Nov. 9, we hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election. We should hope that when Trump loses, take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him.|2022-09-18 06:00:00|FAKE|Owen Rodriguez|The Observer|213394|71619|433|2884|Russia|English|2022-09-09 08:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|694800|1465200|2396|7.216666666666667

These stories were written down in books, which are stored in libraries or on bookshelves. Some of them are pretty good. Museums are another good starting point for learning about the things humanity has created that do not involve an animated creature breathing on a window and then drawing a heart in the steam.

Painter wrote in a New York Times an op-ed: The job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. And that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. This is the second complaint to be filed against FBI Director Comey. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has also filed a complaint against Comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. Suspicion around actions has grown as the FBI Director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. Director Comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as Senate Democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the FBI investigation if they win back the Senate majority. Unless Trump wins and Republicans take control of Congress, Director Comey is going to have to answer for his decisions. As the complaints pile up, it looks like Congressional testimony may be the least of James future problems.|2022-09-22 05:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Global Insight|896147|9877|69|8045|Italy|English|2022-09-17 10:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|1393200|1807200|1761|1.15

Indigenous culture honors American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate, or Buffalo Nation) as a symbol of sacrifice, as the bison give their lives to provide food, shelter, and clothing through the use of their meat and their hides. Native Americans maintain a spiritual tradition with bison , believing that as long as buffalo a gift from the Great Spirit roam free and as long as the herds are bountiful, the sovereignty of indigenous people would remain strong. And in the midst of mass arrests, mace attacks, and beatings from batons, a stampede of bison suddenly appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. A cry of joy reportedly erupted from the Standing Rock Sioux, as they had been praying for assistance from the Tatanka Oyate during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen. As the police response to the Sioux's ongoing nonviolent civil disobedience escalates, tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and stop the mistreatment of the indigenous community. We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone's safety. The Department of Justice must send overseers immediately to ensure the protection of First Amendment rights and the safety of thousands here at Standing Rock, wrote David Archambault II , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.

Now after facing huge pressure even from Clinton News Network (CNN), Donna has finally admitted that the emails are real and that at fault for the collusion. Brazile thanked CNN for her time on the network. Brazile tweeted this message around dinnertime Sunday night.

Last night, Jay Z and Beyonce shared the stage with Hillary Clinton at a concert in Cleveland, Ohio. The A-list couple showed Clinton a stunning amount of support, followed by a powerful speech by the Democratic candidate herself. It was a monumental moment, and Trump hated every second of it. At a rally of his own, Trump hide the fact that he was green with envy. Trump said: going to do it, folks. going to do it. Oh boy, are we going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I have to bring J Lo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing. Trump even try to hide how sorry he felt for himself, and it was obvious that he was trying really hard not to completely lose it over the fact that no one likes him and almost no celebrities want to be affiliated with him. You can watch Trump give his pathetic, desperate speech below: bullsh*t campaign is finally coming to an end. He spent the beginning of his campaign promising America that run a star-studded campaign, and he has almost nothing to show for it almost a year later. Not even his own Republican colleagues wanted to appear with him on the campaign trail, forcing Trump to go it alone. Of course Trump is jealous and bitter. While Clinton need the support of the massive amount of celebrities who have endorsed her, their support is a clear sign that she is doing something right and her campaign is something worth standing by.

6527|Shi’ite Militias Join Iraq’s Mosul Attack|Militia Fighters to Advance on Areas West of City by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This After a week and a half of assuring everyone that their role in the invasion of Mosul would be very limited, and removed from the Sunni population, militias have been announced to have launched an offensive west of Mosul, advancing on Tal Afar . According to officials, the main goal of this offensive is to cut the city of Mosul off from ISIS territory in Syria, preventing the ISIS fighters within the city from fleeing west if the battle begins to turn sour. The offensive is said to start within a few days or hours. The involvement of militias in the liberation of Sunni Arab cities in Iraq has been controversial because they often end up carrying out extrajudicial executions, looting and torture of locals they suspect of being secretly in league with ISIS. An effort to block flight from Mosul to ISIS territory is Syria would be an obvious step, but the involvement again risks targeting of civilians, as the population of from Mosul is already overrunning the minimal camps set up for the displaced. Civilians fleeing these cities are usually not welcomed in Iraqi government-held territory, and wind up fleeing into other ISIS-held territory. With little left in Iraq, this likely means fleeing into Syria, and the presence means the civilians displaced by the attack are likely to be targeted for fleeing with ISIS.

6529|The Trump Campaign Actually Has a Hillary 'Voter Suppression' Strategy with 3 Key Targets|Share on Twitter You've all heard by now that Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton is trying to rig the campaign, including the idea that she's trying to suppress his voters. Now Bloomberg Businessweek has a major new story out on his campaign, including a few fascinating revelations: Nate results have been similar to ours....except they lag by a week or two because relying on public polls. The campaign holds rallies in non-traditional states like New Hampshire and Maine because data shows that's where the most persuadable voters can be found. You meet Brad Parscale, Trump's main digital guy, who has quite a background. Join me on @thedonaldreddit Reddit AMA right now! Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 25, 2016 Most importantly, the story also presents another side of the Trump campaign, an active effort to persuade Democrats not to vote. It concentrates on three key groups. 1) White Liberals invocation at the debate of WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. 2) Young Women The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. 3) African-Americans Her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are super predators is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the in Florida. That strategy in action: On Oct. 24, team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation created of Clinton delivering the super predator line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators. The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook dark posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, only the people we want to see it, see it. The aim is to depress vote total. We know because modeled this, says the official. It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out. Early voting shows that the efforts to decrease turnout may not be working according to the Trump campaign's plan, but it's rare for a campaign to so openly boast of an effort to get people not to vote.|2022-10-04 12:00:00|FAKE|Gabriel Santos|The Daily Dispatch|506381|53575|19|4671|Turkey|English|2022-09-23 15:00:00|Artículo de investigación|0|True|1929600|2869200|2355|0.31666666666666665
6532|Nevada: Rep. Election Workers Intimidated|Nevada: Rep. Election Workers Intimidated November 08, 2016 Myla Gibson, 3, waits as her father Ken Gibson fills out a ballot for the presidential election at the James Weldon Johnson school in East Harlem, Republican volunteers called 911 claiming Clinton supporters were Harassing them. Volunteers canvassing and dropping off literature at houses Monday for Nevada Republican senate candidate Rep. Joe Heck were followed by supporters of Hillary Clinton, who then subsequently pulled down the literature, a source within the Nevada Republican Party told The Daily Caller in an exclusive report. The staffers following them were wearing HRC buttons and HRC stickers. Beyond following them, the HRC workers began going up to houses and illegally removing Heck literature from the doors, the Nevada GOP source said. When the Heck volunteers noticed this going on, they stopped to take pictures of the illegal action. The source said that, Within a few minutes, more HRC campaign workers showed up. At this point, the Heck volunteers began to feel threatened and called 911 to report HRC workers illegally removing campaign literature and harassing the Heck volunteers. Reports like the case in Nevada may seem minor to some, but those that have been called to pray over this election know that it only confirms the need for prayer. The kind of anger and even violence that can manifest during and after elections is something to be taken seriously. We have seen violence erupt during elections in other countries, and it certainly isn't something we want to see in the United States. The call is to pray without ceasing Church!

6542|Russia prevented Spain from diplomatical conflict denying its proposal|"Russia prevented Spain from diplomatical conflict denying its proposal 27.10.2016 | Source: AP Photo Russian ships led by the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier will not enter into the Spanish harbor of Ceuta because of the naval group's route change, the Russian embassy in Spain said Wednesday. ""We confirm that the ships will not enter the Ceuta port because the route has changed,"" stated the embassy official. Earlier the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Madrid was considering granting the Russian naval task group access to Ceuta on October 28-November 2, drawing criticism from NATO. On October 15, the Russian Northern Fleet's press service said that a group of warships headed by the Admiral Kuznetsov, accompanied by the Pyotr Veliky battle cruiser, the Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov anti-submarine destroyers, and support vessels, had been sent to the Mediterranean to hold drills and strengthen capabilities. Such decision may sound ridiculous due to the fact that a week ago Spain has signed the EU's announce on Russian's military offence in Aleppo. Moreover, two weeks ago Spain had developed a resolution that blamed Russian's military activities in Syria. Pravda.Ru's political expert Alexander Chichin revealed the nature of the contrariety of Spain's policy on Russia. Expert said that this decision is connected with NATO's attitude. Initially it all was referred to one tanker which was not an issue for Spain. Then they discovered that there was a whole fleet. Afterwards spanish realised that this fleet included aircraft carrier 'Admiral Kusnetsov', cruiser 'Pyotr Veliky' and antisubmarine aircraft carrier 'Severomorsk'. That's why Spain had to refuse. At the moment spanish people say that they are very ashamed for not refusing straight away. They are disappointed that they have recieved NATO's warn. It is worth mentiong that Spain could have got benefits from this proposal because the country needs money. These ships during only six days could make a great sum of money from Russia to Spain. Spain had to choose between its international authoriy and its inner financial profits. Abandonnig the proposal, Russia saved Spain from resolving this kind of dilemma.

6552|CNBC Just Confirmed Comey Is Abusing His Power To Help Trump|Comments A bombshell report from CNBC confirms that FBI Director James Comey had in fact concluded that the government of the Russian Federation was interfering with the election, but fought to keep that information from being released to the public because it was too close to the election. Instead, Comey prevented the name FBI from appearing on the statement the government ultimately made on October 7th. This attitude stands in stark contrast to the cavalier way in which Director Comey threw a wrench into the election by writing a letter to update Congress on the Hillary Clinton email investigation since the FBI discovered emails that may be pertinent to their previous inquiries. That announcement has drastically shifted the polling landscape of the election and given the Republican Party the final stretch ammunition that the Donald Trump campaign, sinking after weeks of sexual assault revelations, needed to bail themselves out and redirect the national narrative away from their own bad press. The hypocrisy is astounding; it appears that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to hide the machinations by a foreign power to interfere in the elections of the United States to protect the Republican nominee, who has a long documented history with the operatives of said foreign power and a personally profitable reason to cultivate their support. The Director then said that he release that information to the public which definitely deserves to know if a foreign power is interfering with our electoral process because it was too close to the election but then releases an intentionally vague and misleading letter concerning new emails that may or may not be pertinent to an investigation which the FBI itself had already exonerated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over? obvious that Director Comey has joined Congressional Republicans in their efforts to conduct a witch-hunt against one of our most devoted public servants and usher in the election of a treasonous sexual predator instead.|2022-10-01 08:00:00|FAKE|Alexander Lee|Newsline|603059|71365|13|412|Indonesia|English|2022-09-24 20:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2034000|2595600|2035|0.21666666666666667

657|Too Soon? Media Declares Clinton the Presumptive Nominee|"The news media has preempted Tuesday's Democratic presidential primaries, declaring Hillary Clinton the winner. According to The Associated Press, the former secretary of state has the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch her party's nomination, with superdelegates putting her over the top before today's primaries even begin. ""We have a really important election now,"" Clinton said. Still, she urged voters to head to the polls in the six states set to vote Tuesday, including the biggest, California. ""We're going to come out of the primary even stronger to take on Donald Trump,"" she told supporters. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders' campaign is accusing the media of rushing to judgment. ""It is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer. Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination,"" Sanders' spokesperson Michael Briggs said in a statement. The superdelegates will not actually vote until July 25, and Sanders promises to spend the time until then convincing them that he is the stronger candidate. Although the Vermont senator may be on his way out whether he's ready to admit it or not, he's leaving a lasting impact, pushing the Democratic Party left on economic issues and trying to change the party's platform on Israel. Sanders would like the platform to include explicit references to the alleged Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, recognizing a Palestinian state. He's already named some pro-Palestinian representatives to the platform committee, including those who support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The movement aims to delegitimize the Jewish state. Pro-Israel Democrats say those changes in the party's platform would be dead on arrival. But there are some indications the party's grassroots activists are already moving toward the Palestinian side and away from Israel. A recent Pew Research Center analysis shows that for the first time in a decade the percentage of liberal Democrats sympathizing with Palestinians is greater than those aligning with Israel. That division could ultimately lead to a fight at the Democratic National Convention to determine where the party's support lies. But even if that doesn't happen, the split could be an indication that the Democrats may be moving toward more support for Palestinians and possibly less for Israel in the future."|2022-09-20 08:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Capital Gazette|802542|74697|451|2424|Spain|English|2022-09-05 22:00:00|Columna de humor|0|True|1645200|399600|2443|7.516666666666667

As the administration now acknowledges, Obama and Clinton emailed each other while she was helming the State Department. If received on his BlackBerry, the whitelisting safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls.

6589|Clinton Aide Says Future WikiLeaks Releases Are 'Probably Fake'|Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she takes the stage to speak at a fundraiser at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016. Months of embarrassing leaks released by WikiLeaks and other sources related to Hillary presidential campaign and the Democratic leadership have time and again proven to be true , while allegations of Russia being behind the effort have not been substantiated with any evidence. Still, the talking point the campaign continues to go with. And indeed Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri today warned against believing any new things released by WikiLeaks that are embarrassing to the Clinton campaign, even though the other releases were spot on, insisting that anything else they release is probably fake . Friends, please remember that if you see a whopper of a Wikileaks in next two days it's probably a fake. Jennifer Palmieri (@jmpalmieri) November 6, 2016 This a brand new claim, either, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D CA) making claims as far back as August that any future mass leaks would probably include Russian lies designed to embarrass Clinton and the Democrats. These preemptive warnings appear to recognize the reality that more embarrassing information is likely to come out, and aiming to get out in front of the next batch by preemptively declaring them probably not true, whatever it turns out to be.|2022-10-04 21:00:00|FAKE|William Kumar|Press Pulse|142353|74709|170|7858|Italy|English|2022-09-04 09:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|2901600|266400|1390|2.8333333333333335
659|Trump Draws Fire from GOP Leaders over Attacks on Latino Judge|"Republican leaders are taking presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump to task for his attacks on a Latino judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University. Trump is refusing to back down from his contention that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not preside over a fair trial in a fraud case against Trump University because Curiel's parents were born in Mexico. ""He's member of a club or society very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias,"" Trump said of Curiel on CBS' ""Face The Nation."" ""I want to build a wall. I'm going to build a wall."" And Trump went further when pressed on whether he thinks a Muslim judge would also be biased against him. ""It's possible, yes. Yes. That would be possible, absolutely,"" the billionaire said. CBS' John Dickerson then asked Trump, ""Isn't there sort of a tradition though in America that we don't judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?"" ""I'm not talking about tradition,"" Trump replied. ""I'm talking about common sense, okay?"" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter and widely considered a possible running mate, severely criticized his remarks. ""This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made,"" said Gingrich. ""I think it's inexcusable. This judge was born in Indiana. He is an American, period."" But Gingrich added that that he considers Trump a remarkable leader who learns very quickly. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton grabbed the chance to aim her fire at Trump. ""What Trump is doing is trying to divert attention from the very serious fraud charges against Trump University,"" she said on ABC's ""This Week."" And on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also criticized Trump, but would not say if he thought what Trump said was racist. ""I couldn't disagree more with a statement like that,"" McConnell told NBC's Chuck Todd. ""But is it a racist statement?"" Todd pressed. ""I couldn't disagree more with what he said,"" McConnell reiterated. In the meantime, Republican leaders are urging Trump to start unifying the party and start acting like ""a potential leader of the United States."|2022-10-04 13:00:00|REAL|Xavier Chang|The Informer|540669|17913|296|6202|United States|English|2022-09-28 08:00:00|Reseña|1|True|2872800|2336400|2171|4.933333333333334
6595|Muslims Are Kidnapping White Girls And Forcing Them Into Sex Slavery, Says UK Children's Charity|Print Islam and sex slavery are like peanut butter and jelly - you always find the one next to the other. Muslims kidnapping vulnerable white girls in the UK and forcing them to be sex slaves has reached an epidemic level, according to a recent report from the UK Charity Barnados. They say that Muslims are setting up fake businesses, primarily car washes, when, in reality, they are brothels and transit houses for these kidnapped girls: claims girls are being ferried from one unit to another as sex slaves for Kurds[s]. It suggests white British girls on the run from the care system in Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough are being targeted. The report said: There were connections between people that work in car washes and the sexual exploitation of children on Teesside. Officers on the immigration-led operation found beds at one. It was suggested staff were living on the premises. Cleveland Police said: It was not confirmed that child sexual exploitation had taken place although enquiries were conducted. ( source ) This is a sad and sickening picture of what the UK has become. Once one of the safest places in the West, it has allowed itself to become little more than a third-world cesspool, where its own women are being sold like slaves in the Muslim bazaars of old, and the government refuses to do its job to stop it, instead allowing it to continue and trying to stop those who want to put a stop to it.

6599|Genius Kid Trolled White House Halloween Party, Idiot Obama Didn’t Notice|"Genius Kid Trolled White House Halloween Party, Idiot Obama Notice Posted on November 1, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This During certain holidays, Barack and Michelle Obama invite a few kids to the White House to join them in the festivities. However, the most recent incident like all the rest as one kid decided to troll everyone there with a genius costume idea and our idiot president even seem to notice what he did. Yesterday, a few kids were invited to the White House Rose Garden in order to dress up for the annual Halloween trick-or-treat event. Although most kids were there for the candy and games, there was one costume that stood above the rest a duck. Now, this exactly your typical duck costume with a kid inside, and he your ordinary kid either. As can be seen in a picture posing with Obama, the duck was actually bandaged with its arm in a sling, thereby actually making it a lame duck . Obama meets kid dressed as ""lame duck"" for Halloween at WH  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 31, 2016 Of course, Obama is about to adopt that name after the election as he begins the home stretch of his presidency. Although he done anything except for forcing his legacy down throat, these are the few months where slacking off is actually accepted from a man in his position. At this point, a few things are unclear, including whether this kid was suggesting that Obama was a lame duck for his entire presidency or if our so-called Commander-in-Chief actually caught the genius pun. While some say he took the comedic jab with a bit of humor, others suggest the moron missed the subtle trolling entirely as it was just one of the endless droves of children in costumes that he took a picture with. unknown who was actually in the costume or if the idea came from the child or their father, but being shared around social media for good reason. Obama has been nothing but a lame duck for the past 8 years after idiot voters actually believing the hope and change spiel voted for the man twice. Fortunately, his days of freeloading and kicking back are about to become a thing of the past. Although nothing will change during his lame duck months, freeloaders of our nation are about to get a kick in the backside when Donald Trump is elected. We have been doing nothing for far too long time we kick things into high gear and actually do some great things, just like we used to do."|2022-10-02 01:00:00|FAKE|Noah Khan|Daily Digest|526368|74190|88|8915|Italy|English|2022-09-09 08:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|694800|2656800|2394|1.4666666666666666

Williams said Admiral decision to offer better insurance deals to people with Facebook profiles that looked to their quotation algorithm had led to an afternoon of frantic social activity. He explained, Obviously, as a millennial social media user, I only ever share things that will impress my friends, future employers and potentially those women who happen across my Facebook profile from any of the number of dating apps I use. So sharing and posting things purely to make myself look better is nothing new to me. Tweaking that for an insurance company was pretty easy. I simply liked a number of Facebook pages about driver safety, signed a petition calling for lower speed limits on UK roads, added a couple of driving safety courses as Life Events, and even put a couple of posts on my historic timeline about how people are way too fast past the school these Also, Driving Miss Daisy is now my favourite film, by the way.

6614|Muslims Terrorize Hindus Because It's Wednesday|Muslims Terrorize Hindus Because It's Wednesday November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield The official media narrative is that Muslims are the world's greatest victims. The truth, especially in majority Muslim countries, is rather strikingly different . Crowds of Muslims attacked Hindu homes and temples in eastern Bangladesh this week, raising concerns that the authorities are not taking steps to curb rising religious tensions. Attacks on Hindus are not unusual in Bangladesh, but it is rare to see multiple crowds targeting temples in an organized way as they did on Sunday and Monday. Note the casual language of the Times. Muslim religious violence is commonplace in Bangladesh. It's just not common for it to be happening on this scale. But how could it be otherwise? Islam is structurally xenophobic, violently bigoted and racist down to its origins. Islam's faith is expressed in a violent campaign against non-Muslims. This is Jihad. Muslims attacking Hindus, Christians, Jews, Yazidis or any other group? That just means it must be Wednesday. Or any other day of the week. On Sunday, hundreds of Muslims entered a Hindu neighborhood, where they ransacked 15 temples and the homes of more than 100 families, Mr. Deb said. He said that the mob used long, hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons to assault Hindus they found there, and that at least 20 people, including a priest, were wounded. This is Islam in its purest and truest form.|2022-10-09 03:00:00|FAKE|Sophie Chen|Newsflash|197878|62384|627|9331|Pakistan|English|2022-09-07 06:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3268800|514800|1444|10.45

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu walks out following a press conference at his Jerusalem office on Tuesday, July 14, 2015. A French government effort to hold a Middle East peace conference in Paris next month is off to a rocky start, with Israel summoning the French Ambassador to inform him that they oppose the effort and will not attend the Paris meeting under any conditions. France has been talking up the idea of trying to get a new peace process going for months, with Israeli officials expressing serious concern that the United States might not veto a French resolution on the peace process at the UN Security Council. Israeli officials today accused the conference of being a distraction. Palestinian officials had already endorsed the conference before Israel rejected it, and Palestinian spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah insisted that they remain in favor of holding the conference to discuss ideas for getting the peace process going whether or not Israel attends. French officials have not commented on refusal to participate, but probably will go ahead with the planned conference, as rejection is not a surprise. Indeed, much of the current far-right government has reacted negatively to the idea of a peace process in general, and has been particularly hostile toward the French effort throughout.|2022-10-08 16:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|The Informer|636090|63751|204|1273|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-27 23:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3229200|2304000|1483|3.4

But instead of owning up to their past misdeeds, Democrats peddle the fiction of a reset that saw the racists in their party migrate to the GOP, allowing them to become a kinder, more tolerant organization.

The billionaire had trouble understanding how African-Americans could possibly vote differently from him however, expressing the sentiment that they were seriously f***ed in the head for supporting the GOP and comparable to Jews who sold out their people during the Holocaust.

Doctors in clinics in the towns of Jirjanaz and Maaret al-Nouman in the northeastern province of Idlib said children started falling ill shortly after the vaccinations were administered. The mass vaccination drive was part of a high profile international effort to ensure the brutal civil war does not result in an outbreak of measles. Reports on the number of children vary and are expected to climb. Relief organizations just over the border in Turkey said the loss of life was extensive, rising as high as 36 plus more than a dozen other children in a life-threatening conditions. The Syrian rebel government, which controls the area of Idlib province and is attempting to oust Assad, had been administering the program with international support. They have since announced the immunization project has been stopped. Parents accused rebel government health authorities of failing to store the vaccines properly, and of supplying out-of-date medication. But opposition officials denied accusations of negligence, saying that the vaccines came from Unicef and WHO, and that the same batch had successfully vaccinated 60,000 schoolchildren in 30 locations in recent days. very bad.

But the rebel government are blaming the Assad government.

The WHO said it was urgently checking the reports and could not confirm the toll. Other well-followed Syrian monitoring groups said there had been deaths.

AG Loretta Lynch has been reportedly blocking an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation that many say is a global charity fraud and a huge criminal conspiracy. The leaked emails and documents show corruption between the Justice Department and Hillary Clinton. These documents and emails also show a grand cover-up of the true treason that has taken place in the highest offices of the U.S. government. The mainstream media (MSM) have been committing fraud on shareholders and the public by holding themselves out as news organizations when, in fact, they are functioning as propaganda for the Clinton campaign. no surprise that the biggest newspaper, USA Today (GCI), has had its share price cut in half in the last a year. Reuters is laying off 2,000 people, and quarterly profits at the New York Times have fallen by 95%. The public is not buying the lies and propaganda the MSM is selling for the Democrats and the Clinton Campaign. Internet researcher Clif High says both the MSM and the Democrat Party are dying. He says by 2020, the Democrat party will not exist, and the MSM will be well on its way to its death. Join Greg Hunter as he talks about these stories and more in the Weekly News Wrap-Up.

6673|The illuminati card ‘Enough Is Enough’ a harbinger of things to come?|The illuminati card Is a harbinger of things to come? For more than two decades the infamous Illuminati Card Game, created in 1994 by Steve Jackson, has been proven to be a remarkably accurate when it comes to the prediction for future events. Already several worldwide events had their own card prior to the evening happening. Now The US elections are behind us and Donald Trump has been elected as the next US President, once again there are two cards which really stand out. Both cards bear a striking resemblance to Donald Trump. The first card shows a man speaking to a fanatic crowd with the following text: The increased power takes immediately effect. The second card is shows the likeness to Donald Trump with a bullet whizzing by his head with the following text: At any time, our snipers lay you in every place. Have a nice day. Now that Donald Trump has come so far to become the 45th president, the people in power want him stopped before he causes any more upset to their status quo. It means that he will become a target. Some of their methods to stop Donald Trump: Sabotage, economic crisis, civil unrest, false flag operations, cyber attacks and if they have no success to stop him then it is quite possible that they play their last card: Assassination. Very disturbing is also the warning of Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian-born prophet - who died in 1996 aged 85, and who had an alleged prediction success rate of 85 per cent. She correctly predicted that the 44th President of the United States would be an African-American and this black President (Obama) would be the last US President. Obama technically remains President until Donald Trump is sworn in on January 20, 2017 but if Baba prediction would be correct again then something will happen with Donald Trump before January 20, 2017 and Barack Obama will serve a third term with all its consequences. Baba prediction and especially the second card could be a warning for an upcoming assassination attempt against Donald Trump?

(Photo by Reuters) The Fourth High Criminal Court of Bahrain has sentenced 15 political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them. While several international rights groups have criticized the Al Khalifa harsh crackdown on the Bahraini opposition, the Western powers turn a blind eye to the Arab violations of human rights. Edward Corrigan, an international human rights lawyer, told Press Top 5 program that the Western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the Arab dictatorships in the Persian Gulf region because such regimes are considered the lap dogs. There is a double standard, Corrigan said, explaining that Western powers say, you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into European or American economy, we question your human rights According to the analyst, There is hypocrisy, double standards and this is really a big political game. Our dictatorships and allies are OK but somebody else that we like for whatever reason, we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them. Elsewhere in his remarks, Corrigan said the definition of terrorism in Bahrain covers any kind of opposition, because the regime does not want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system, to redress this massive discrimination against the Shia population, and to have any sort of voice for democracy; so, all of that is He added, It is against the international law to remove nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment, very draconian, as condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations.

Jury selection begins on Monday in the case of Michael Slager, a white former policeman in North Charleston charged with murder in state court after he fatally shot unarmed black motorist Walter Scott in April 2015. One week later on Nov. 7, a federal death penalty trial is slated to start for avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof, who is accused of killing nine black parishioners during Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015. The nearly simultaneous proceedings will take place at courthouses across the street from each other in the heart of downtown district. Black community activists said the outcomes will test the calm that prevailed after the shootings and could trigger unrest if those angry about the killings feel justice is not served. The community is, for lack of better words, on eggshells, said Justin Bamberg, a state legislator and lawyer who represents family. Both trials are expected to last several weeks and draw national attention to the port city of about 133,000 people that is known for its cuisine and well-preserved 18th and 19th century architecture. But Bamberg said the cases have important distinctions. trial is less about his guilt or innocence than whether he will be sentenced to life in prison or death, Bamberg said. lawyers have said he would plead guilty to 33 counts of hate crimes, obstruction of religion and firearms charges if prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. case, on the other hand, could produce a rare result: a guilty verdict against a U.S. police officer charged with murder or manslaughter.

Each year the charity is selected by a different county commissioner. This year, County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay selected the Boys and Girls Clubs of Palm Beach County to receive the benefit. And course signed on to sponsor the fundraiser. But McKinlay learned this week from Assistant County Administrator Todd Bonlarron that people were requiring the charity to pay $20,000 in golf and catering fees. In the past, fees had reportedly been capped at $5,000. In an email this week, Mark Casale, vice president philanthropy for the Boys and Girls Clubs, told McKinlay and Assistant County Administrator Todd Bonlarron that course was effectively asking for half of the proceeds from the fundraiser.

6727|Hillary Lies About Her Whereabouts On 9/11|During a rally in Tuesday night in Florida, Hillary Clinton lied. Wait a second, not surprising. like saying the sky is blue . . . unless a liberal, in which case probably say the sky is green and how dare you discriminate against it. Via TruthAndAction At least you can say this about Hillary Clinton, consistent. a consistent liar, a consistent hypocrite and most of all, a consistent criminal. Unlike most of her past lies, which have somewhat intricate and easy to believe for the lazy minded, her latest lie is so far-fetched and comes at a time when seeking as much sympathy as she can get, that you would have to be the biggest idiot to believe it. During her rally in Florida, Hillary claimed that she was in New York City on 9/11. The only problem is that she Not even the media can back up this claim, because many of them wrote sob stories about how she was in Washington that day. Uh oh . . . Not only was she not in New York, a story published by Politico about exactly what she did that day and how she reacted when she heard the news. Clinton did go to New York, but not until the following the day. She had CNN on as she talked on the phone with her legislative director when the first plane hit. Then the second. By the time she got to the Capitol, the Pentagon had been hit by a third plane. Capitol police were evacuating Senate office buildings. She dialed her daughter, who was in New York. She dialed her husband, who was in Australia. She and other senators received a briefing at the Capitol police station early in the evening. And after a day indelibly etched in my mind, and as nightfall approached, Clinton joined congressional colleagues on the steps of the Capitol, standing next to some of her fiercest political opponents, singing God Bless America with tears in her eyes. Her statements came as she was opening old wounds revolving around the Pulse night club in Florida. She claimed that she was in New York on 9/11 and that she would defeat ISIS and protect America. Does that include from herself? hope she get the opportunity.

6741|Clinton Staffer Caught Sacrificing Baby to Demon Moloch - Wikileaks|According to a new Wikileaks email leak , a Clinton staffer has been caught sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . Chicken is a code-word for children, babies among pedophile and satanic ranks. Moloch is a Demon to which the ancient Jewish people of the past were caught by Moses while they were sacrificing their own babies when he was on top of Mount Sinai receiving the 10 Commandments from God. Moses was so angry and upset that he broke the first set of the 10 Commandments! He condemned and damned everyone. He later went to the mountain again and got a second set of of the 10 Commandments. In Leviticus 18:21 God forbid the chosen people to do such a horrible thing: Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Moloch, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD. God also ordered in Leviticus 20:2 to 20:5 that any follower of Moloch must be put to death: Say to the Israelites: Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Moloch is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Moloch, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Moloch and if they fail to put him to death, I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Moloch. This is NOT a joke people, this is serious SATANIST stuff and either you believe in God or not, your problem, but what matters is that these people DO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY DO! 16 years ago, on 15 July 2000 Alex Jones was the first and only to date, to ever infiltrate and secretly videotape the Bohemian Grove .

Arnoldski - On October 27th, 2016, as a result of joint operative-investigative activities between Russian and Turkish intelligence, in Instanbul were arrested leaders and active participants of an underground gang from the North Caucasus region and Crimea, who were hiding from Russian law enforcement on Turkish territory. During the course of the operation, representatives of the Crimean branch of Hizb -ut-Tahrir and the North Caucasus wing of ISIS, totaling 80 people, were arrested. In line with the agreement with intelligence services, their extradition to Russia is being resolved. A high-ranking source in security structures explained to Russian Spring that Turkish intelligence transfer of information on the Crimean Tatar and North Caucasus terrorist network to the Russian side, timed for the meeting between Putin and Erdogan in Sochi, was a gesture of thanks for intelligence warnings about the coup that failed in July, 2016.

677|Poll: 71 percent of Dems think Clinton should keep running even if indicted|"A strong majority of Democratic voters think Hillary Clinton should keep running for president even if she is charged with a felony in connection with her private email use while secretary of state, according to a new poll. Clinton was strongly criticized in a State Department inspector general report last week about her email use. The report found repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told never to speak of the personal email system again. Yet, this seems not to be a big issue among Democrats. The Rasmussen poll released Tuesday found 71 percent of Democratic voters believe she should keep running even if indicted, a view shared by only 30 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of unaffiliated voters. Overall, 50 percent of those polled said she should keep running. The FBI investigation into her email practices is still ongoing. Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders has avoided commenting specifically on that probe, but campaign manager Jeff Weaver on Wednesday questioned whether she could keep going if an indictment comes down. ""That would be difficult to continue running a race,"" Weaver told Fox News on Wednesday, when asked about the poll. The email scandal could still be problematic for Clinton's general election hopes, with 40 percent of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for Clinton because of it -- though 48 percent of voters said it would have no impact on their vote. The Democratic primary argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is also apparently failing to sway many voters. According to the poll, 65 percent of voters consider it likely that Clinton broke the law with her email use, with 47 percent saying very likely. The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 29-30. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage points."|2022-10-02 03:00:00|REAL|Avery Kim|Daily Digest|711933|64574|155|675|Turkey|English|2022-09-16 09:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|2664000|1303200|1847|2.5833333333333335

Speaking in Charlotte, N.C., the GOP presidential nominee criticized years of Democratic rule for leaving black America behind and outlined his plan to help. My deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education and high-paying jobs, Trump said, speaking off what appeared to be scripted remarks Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. We live in a very divided country, and I will be your greatest champion. {snip} African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines, lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights. Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind. Trump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare blighted communities disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure. He also said support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities. But while call focused on removing gang members and criminal cartels, he blamed Clinton for promoting a war on police. He did not mention the accusations of police brutality by minorities who feel that they are disproportionately targeted. {snip}|2022-09-22 06:00:00|FAKE|Sophie Chen|Urban News|750178|71850|249|9086|DR Congo|English|2022-09-13 01:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|1015200|1810800|1653|4.15

The film, titled Repent and you have safety from us, is directed at Russians and Putin, threatening violence at the Syrian government ally. The nearly 14-minute video was released on ISIS terrorist channels on November 9 and comes from Wilayat al-Jazirah, northern Iraq. Vulnerable cities in the ISIS-occupied region include Tal Al-Mahlabiyyah, Sinjar, Wardiyyah, Sanuni, Khana Sor, Ibrat al-Saghira, Al-Badi, [and] Al-Qanat. Prisoners can be seen kneeling on the ground in an unknown location in northern Iraq, while so-called 'cubs of the caliphate', dressed in military outfits, stand behind them wielding hand guns.

This weekend's Diwali celebrations all over India have caused more pollution than Chinese factories produce in a year! The WHO measured record levels of air pollution hanging above major cities and declared India an environmental catastrophe! The Indian government refused to comment on the catastrophe fueling the idea that they purposely allowed, encouraged and perpetrated the environmental disaster to happen in the hope that it would cause a cull in their over-bloated population. The WHO are sending scientists in to Indian's major cities to find out how many people have died after inhaling huge amounts of smoke caused by their own fireworks. Under the cover of a thick layer of smog, government bulldozers were observed cleaning up the debris, dead bodies and giving holy cows smog masks; the perfect cover-up. Exactly how many people did not survive the celebrations is not yet clear because it will take days for the smog to disintegrate, but the Indian Government are hoping the bulldozers will do a fine job and many slums surrounding Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, etc, will be half empty when the smog disappears! The annual celebration of suicidal firework displays will continue until the Indian Government cull the population by at least a third and proposals to engage ISIS to help in organizing future Diwali festivals has received a positive response from ISIS fighters fleeing Iraqi bombs in Mosul. ISIS fighters have been promised refuge and amnesty if they can organize mass killings in India just as good as they did in Syria and Iraq!

The how-to example in the video below is made from approximately 12 feet of copper tubing plus a few fittings (the stainless steel tube option is shown too). Follow the instructions in the video below to learn how to build it yourself. If a torch isn't something you have in your tool kit you can find push on fittings from a hardware store that you won't need to solder. NOTE: It is absolutely imperative if you do choose to solder your device, that you use lead-free solder. Prior to 1986, solder in the U.S. contained an alarmingly high content of lead. Chances are, if you live in a house built before the 1980's your tap water is contaminated with the neurotoxin lead due to leeching solder on your water pipes. All the more reason to filter your water with a device like this! Lead solder was the industry standard after all. Watch below: We don't have a water problem.

6781|Trump Is Deadbeating On His Campaign Debts By Refusing To Pay His Own Pollster|The Washington Post reported: Donald hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that firm says it is still owed for polling. decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given history of not paying for services performed; it be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. Donald mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. Anybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket.

6787|US: Kurdish Troops Will Be Involved in Invading ISIS Capital of Raqqa|Turkish Objections Won't Stop YPG's Involvement by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This US Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the leader of the US military forces in Iraq and Syria , today announced that Kurdish YPG forces will participate in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite Turkish government demands that the Kurds not be allowed to take part. Townsend was a bit vague on the details of Kurdish involvement, saying the US are going to take this in steps, and that Turkey has to realize the only way that the US is going to have enough force to take over Raqqa any time soon is with a significant portion of the YPG involved. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that his government wants only local forces involved in the Raqqa battle, and that the YPG, who Turkey considers a terrorist organization, must not be allowed to take part in any way. military has been attacking the YPG in several locations around Syria over the past week, including heavy airstrikes which killed an estimated 200 YPG fighters who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS around Afrin. The Turkish government has repeatedly complained the YPG is gaining too much territory in Syria, and that they must abandon much of it.

Bernie Sanders said Sunday that American voters, superdelegates and others must take a hard look at the recent federal report that found primary rival Hillary email setup while running the State Department broke agency rules. It was not a good report for Secretary Clinton. That is something that the American people, Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look at,"" Sanders told CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" during one of two TV network interviews Sunday. The inspector report last week concluded Clinton broke agency rules by using a private email server and that she would have been denied permission to have one had she first sought permission. On Sunday, Sanders, desperately trailing the front-running Clinton in the delegate count, continued to not comment directly on the controversy. But he repeated the notion that superdelegates, of which he needs more in a longshot bid to take the nomination, should indeed scrutinize the report. I mean everybody in America is keeping it in mind, and certainly the superdelegates are,"" Sanders said. The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that the report shows ""just how consistent (Clinton's) email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal email."" The campaign also said the report notes that Clinton's use of personal email was known to officials within the department and that there is no evidence to show any successful breach of the former secretary of state's server. In a separate interview Sunday with Meet the Press, Sanders said he is focused on the future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems they are facing. He also declined to comment on the FBI investigation into the Clinton email scandal, including what impact the findings might have on a Clinton general election bid. However, Sanders appeared to perhaps take his concerns about the emails a step further, suggesting Americans are tired of those kinds of politics. And he made clear presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has and will continue to make an issue of them if and when he faces Clinton directly in the November election. Donald Trump and other Republicans will seize on it, he told NBC. no doubting that."|2022-09-24 18:00:00|REAL|Daniel Patel|The Reporter|367265|47088|239|8110|Turkey|English|2022-09-03 23:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|2026800|230400|2304|3.9833333333333334
6790|Comment on Leaked Email: ‘If She Wins, Hillary Will Own The Supreme Court for the Next 30 to 40 Years’ by mildred.kraus|Posted on October 27, 2016 by Melissa Dykes This. Is. Horrifying. In another Wikileaks email , this time from Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council Marc Stanley to Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta dated February 11, 2016, Stanley lays out his best argument for why voters should choose Hillary over (click to enlarge) He writes: I tell the voter that I like Bernie and I like Hillary, but not what matters. What matters to me is that there are 4 justices on the Supreme Court who will be in their and be replaced by the next president and that President will appoint 40 year old Justices and they will serve for 30 or 40 years. He goes on to say that voters want Republicans making decisions about issues like Obamacare, Citizens United, voter rights, etc. and that Bernie is a 20-1 horse versus Hillary as a 1-1 or even 2-1 horse. Can you imagine it? Hillary being able to personally nominate four out of nine Supreme Court justices for life ? Hillary will own half the Supreme Court and for long after gone. seven out of or the entire Supreme Court, basically. Think about that for a second. Just let it sink in.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Hillary Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe contributed in excess of $675,500 to the Senate candidacy of the wife of FBI agent Deputy Director Andrew McCabe who oversaw the investigation into her use of an illegal homebrew server that exposed our national secrets to Russian hackers. McAuliffe has been a Democrat operative whose willingness to do the dirty work over a long number of years saw him rewarded with the governorship of Virginia. As governor, McAuliffe recruited the wife of the lead investigator to be his senate nominee at the behest of Hillary Clinton who was already being investigated by the FBI. Acting on the direction of Hillary Clinton, PAC contributed $467,500 directly to the Senate Campaign of D. Jill McCabe according to campaign finance records.

Friatider It is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here, one of the illegals living in Skallberget in Vasteras writes in a letter to the editor in the local newspaper VLT. Vasteras has recently been subjected to a long series of car fires. The submitter tries the young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, explain what the phenomenon is due. He writes that he came to Sweden when he was young and admittedly had good potential but that he was subject to persistent racism by the authorities. (What race is Islam?)

Sometimes it was because of ethnicity, sometimes because they were at a certain place, and sometimes just to those very people who were in power felt to fuck with us. So many times I had been propped up against the wall and strip-searched in front of my loved ones. It really depressed me and my value, he writes. The man writes that the young people in the area feel oppressed and that they are burning cars to get the environment to react and listen. Among other things, he complains that the objectives of the local football field does not have a network and that it is not organized enough activities for young people. In short, it is clear as hell that we take out our frustration by destroying and vandalizing when we have a shortage of activities here.

68|The Overwhelming Stress of Being Denied a Bathroom|A recent viral video showed a woman wielding a Bible overhead and marching through a Target, ringing out her message through the brightly lit aisles. a mother of 12 and disgusted by this wicked practice, she cried. Mothers, get your children out of this store a dangerous place! The woman, who has not been identified, is not the only one incensed by announcement that it would allow transgender customers to use the restroom that matches their gender identity. More than 700,000 people have pledged to boycott the store. move, meanwhile, was seen as a response to a new North Carolina law that requires people in government buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the sex on their birth effect forcing post-transition transgender people to use the bathroom of the opposite sex. The idea that children, especially girls, will somehow be hurt by relieving themselves alongside transgender women has been one of the main arguments of the proponents. In the words of Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Men should not be going to the bathroom with little girls. no evidence that municipalities that have protected trans restroom access have seen a spike in public-safety issues. But according to some studies, not having protected restroom access can be harmful for trans people. According to a study by Georgia State Kristie L. Seelman, being denied bathroom access is correlated with an increased risk of suicide attempts among trans people. Transgender people have said bathroom access is one of their most pressing challenges, Seelman writes in the study, which was published in February in the Journal of Homosexuality. Trans people have reported getting stared at or being asked to leave, something that causes them great stress, according to researchers. Seelman highlights an earlier study of 93 trans people that found 68 percent had been verbally harassed in bathrooms, and 9 percent were physically assaulted.|2022-09-19 18:00:00|REAL|Chloe Nguyen|The Chronicle|449543|82945|554|6678|Myanmar|English|2022-09-02 12:00:00|Análisis|1|True|1594800|104400|1917|9.233333333333333

6810|Repudiating the Media|Q. If Trump wins can it be considered a repudiation of the national news mediocrity? A. I certainly hope so! The performance of the major news outlets this election cycle has been something to behold. been the worst, most shallow undertaking I can remember. And I remember the treatment Goldwater got. I wrote here on blog last week about the hysterical reaction Gloria Borger and others had to unwillingness to promise to respect the election results in advance. They acted like panicked teenage girls in a horror movie. Pat Buchanan explains the panic. The establishment is terrified that it has lost the country, he says. The country no longer believes in its leadership. About time! Now with the Comey development it be long before Dems start talking about a rigged system. Another moment of equal media idiocracy: When the Clintonistas blamed Russia for spilling DNC emails that showed its secret collaboration with Hillary and against Bernie Sanders. Trump said Russia, if listening, I hope able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing! The line well-delivered. But it was still funny. Even so, the joke was lost on the usual suspects. I watched Jake visage grow dark as he expressed grave concern that Trump was inviting the Russians to interfere in our election. The whole thing brings to mind an old vaudeville comedy routine with, say, Joe and Moe: Joe: offended by the alarmist reaction to email joke. Moe: Are you offended as a Trump supporter? Joe: No, offended as a person with a sense of humor! 11:09 am on October 29, 2016|2022-09-25 09:00:00|FAKE|Avery Kim|Express Tribune|133921|32654|402|2841|Sudan|English|2022-09-10 03:00:00|Entrevista|1|True|2080800|763200|1541|6.7

6817|"‘I Don’t Rent To N s’: Smoking Gun Proves Trump Family Racism (VIDEO) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave"|on October 25, 2016 10:41 pm · New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him I rent to the n-word, and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting run-in with the federal government over discrimination. Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a C on the documents for colored, and that was a sign that they should be denied. The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. Donald involvement with his business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away still there.

The model was that everything started there, and then everything spread out from there, including maybe the people, said Melinda A. Zeder, a senior research scientist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. But in recent years, Dr. Zeder and other archaeologists have overturned that consensus. Their research suggests that people were inventing farming at several sites in the Fertile Crescent at roughly the same time. In the Zagros Mountains of Iran, for example, Dr. Zeder and her colleagues have found evidence of the gradual domestication of wild goats over many centuries around 10,000 years ago. People may have been cultivating plants earlier than believed, too. In the 1980s, Dani Nadel, then at Hebrew University, and his colleagues excavated a 23,000-year-old site on the shores of the Sea of Galilee known as Ohalo II. It consisted of half a dozen brush huts. Last year, Dr. Nadel co-authored a study showing that one of the huts contained 150,000 charred seeds and fruits, including many types, such as almonds, grapes and olives, that would later become crops. . A stone blade found at Ohalo II seemed to have been used as a sickle to harvest cereals. A stone slab was used to grind the seeds. It seems clear the inhabitants were cultivating wild plants long before farming was thought to have begun. We got fixated on the very few things we just happened to see preserved in the archaeological record, and we got this false impression that this was an abrupt change, Dr. Zeder said. Now we really understand there was this long period where playing around with resources. re|2022-09-29 19:00:00|FAKE|Noah Khan|The Reporter|566704|18546|277|3924|Germany|English|2022-09-22 02:00:00|Reportaje|1|True|2462400|1796400|1880|4.616666666666666

Source: Yuri Smityuk/TASS A full-grown Amur tiger has been caught near the Russian Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and sent for rehabilitation to a special center. The large feline predator is a male weighing 170 kilograms (roughly 375 pounds) that had killed a cow in the town of Artyom about 40 kilometers from Vladivostok, the Amur Tiger press service reported. ""On the morning of Oct. 26, a resident of the Artyom town suburb reported to the police that a tiger had killed a That same evening a response team from the hunting supervision agency spotted the tiger using an infrared camera. The predator was immediately caught and brought to the Tiger Rehabilitation and Reintroduction Center in the Alekseyevka settlement,"" the Amur Tiger Center said. The tiger will stay at the rehabilitation center while experts determine his future. He may be released into the wild in an area far from human settlements but inhabited with enough ungulates (or hoofed mammals). Ecologists had a similar experience last year, when a tiger named Uporny (or who had been attacking dogs in the Khabarovsk region, was caught and later released into a distant area. Tiger cub found prowling the streets of Vladivostok Only a few days ago, another male tiger was caught 20 kilometers away from Vladivostok. The predator not only walked near the city but also entered the city territory. He, too, has been sent to the rehabilitation center. It is a young male tiger weighing 140 kilograms (roughly 308 pounds) who is likely to be released into the wild. Several weeks ago reports of a tiger were received from neighboring town of Artyom but the search ended without any success. The Amur tiger is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

6851|Assange: Donald Trump Won’t Be Allowed to Win – Clinton & ISIS Funded by Same Interests|In an excerpt of a John Pilger Special interview, Julian Assange says that emails released by Wikileaks show that Hillary Clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which US allies are supporting ISIS, and that Donald Trump will not be allowed into the oval office. Assange explains that the same financial interests funding ISIS are funding Clinton. He references a 2014 email from John Podesta to Clinton, in which we find the following: While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection, said Assange. All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS. Pilger asked Assange about the possibility that Trump would steal the election with the help of Russia, as many in the Democratic party claim. Assange thinks that this is highly unlikely, but not because he is unpopular. My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them establishment, he explained. Assange says that Hillary is the establishment pick. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple We encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ).

6852|Comey Bias Exposed As FBI Boss Refused To Call Out Russians For Hacking Before Election|By Jason Easley on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 4:22 pm A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clinton's emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. Share on Twitter Print This Post A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. CNBC reported : FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former FBI official tells CNBC. According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: A foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election. position, this official said, was if it is said, it come from the FBI, which as recall it did not. Director Comey want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. With each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Comey may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. When the information was bad for Donald Trump, Comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Hillary campaign. It is becoming clear that Comey has abused his power and must be removed as FBI Director immediately.|2022-10-07 17:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Insight|194592|13168|148|156|Argentina|English|2022-09-22 21:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|3146400|1864800|2160|2.466666666666667

By Amanda Froelich The glitz and glamor of a circus show might make it appear as if an life with the troupe is a joyous one, but nothing could be further from the truth. After an elephant is domesticated and trained (aka has its spirit broken it spends the majority of its days in chains , is poked and prodded to perform crowd-pleasing feats, and often suffers injuries which result from living in abnormal conditions. Additionally, not unusual for circus beasts to be beaten by their trainers . Every now and again, fortunately, elephants made to perform for the purpose of entertaining humans are removed from the circus and relocated to sanctuaries. There, they are able to live among their kind and enjoy life on their terms. And now that the first elephant sanctuary in all of Latin America has opened, this is likely to become a reality for many more of the gargantuan land mammals. Elephant Sanctuary Brazil will be located on a 2,800-acre plot of land. Located in Chapada dos Guimarães, Mato Grosso, the sanctuary will host 50 rescued circus animals. Animal rights activists secured the location for $1 million and are actively seeking elephants to take in. According to GoodNewsNetwork , the first two elephants to find sanctuary were Guida and Maia, who are believed to have been rescued from Thailand where they performed in circuses. While the sanctuary will not be available to the public, it will post updates about the well-being of rescued elephants via Facebook and through the Global Elephant Sanctuary website .

6865|"Doctor Finds New Life As A Clown More Fulfilling | GomerBlog"|Tweet Pediatrician Jim Smith is thrilled with his new career as a professional Clown. He specializes in birthday parties but has the skill set to perform at kindergarten graduations as well. Leaving the hospital was the best thing ever done. Can I say that again? said an elated Dr. Jim Smith. Dr. Jim Smith first became interested in becoming a Clown after suffering from extreme burnout. Catalysts included helicopter Moms, antivax Jenny Mccarthy supporters, and the general stress of saving the world. After dealing with one particularly overbearing soccer mom, he stormed out of the office ranting, **** this noise; I take this horse**** anymore! and never returned. Using obscenities for the first time felt nothing short of liberating. Dr. Jim new lifestyle is entirely different from the clinic he used to work at. Previously, he woke up at 6am sharp but now he rolls out of bed in the neighborhood of 11:30am to ensure he is prompt for lunchtime birthday contracts. I take my responsibilities very seriously, said Dr. Jim Smith proudly. After a solid hour of challenging work, he practices his Downward Dog poses. In spite of all the Clown perks, Jim has admittedly taken a rather large pay cut. As a pediatrician, the Doctor made $200,000.00 per year. Now he makes $17,500.00 a year if fully booked and tipped generously. However, Dr. Jim Smith says that eating Ramen noodles with his wife and kids is definitely worth the consistent joy he experiences performing slapstick routines. Freedom really has no price tag, said Clown Jim Smith. Dr. Jim favorite part of the job is showcasing his balloon skills. Even though the kids cry sometimes, they die, he stated enthusiastically. Creating these balloon animals has proved to be significantly more meaningful than diagnosing heart defects. Dr. Jim Smith sleeps soundly knowing the nurses hunting (him) down like cattle. Instead, parents and children alike watch him smile and laugh as if the greatest entertainer in the world. He even gets to wear a red nose! And doing mime is endlessly entertaining and unpredictable too. Dr. Jim old colleagues have inquired what degree is needed to become a Clown. also expressed curiosity as to whether it is a high demand skill. Dr. Jim only regret is that he become a Clown sooner. 315 Shares|2022-09-21 22:00:00|FAKE|Alexander Lee|Echo News|725452|13758|73|1530|France|English|2022-09-01 12:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1782000|18000|2290|1.2166666666666666

This is the second installment of a three part video series titled ""Mount Shasta's Legends"". Native American lore suggests that an ancient race of prehistoric giants inhabited the mountains of northern California, but most of them perished in a Great Flood. In 1934, a treasure-hunter claimed to have found evidence suggesting that some these giants lived in tunnels underground around the Mount Shasta area, but before he could reveal the location he mysteriously vanished.

6878|VIDEO: Cop Crashes Car and Runs Away When More Cops Arrive|An award-winning California state trooper was caught on camera fleeing the scene after crashing his patrol car into a parked vehicle and a utility pole, snapping it in half, on Thursday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. When other officers approached and asked him to explain what happened, officer Daniel Kenney refused to get out of the vehicle. With at least three officers surrounding the front end of the car, Kenney reverses and then speeds away past a cameraman across the street. Kenney, a state park K-9 officer, is now on paid administrative leave. Nearly 1,000 homes and business in the area were left without power. Officers placed Kenney in handcuffs when he eventually decided to pull over. He was taken to a hospital where it was determined that he was not intoxicated. A man inside the parked vehicle which Kenney struck suffered minor injuries and was taken to the hospital, according to Action News Now.

Our role is no different today. President-elect Trump, as you assume the highest office, we urge you to reconsider and change course on certain campaign promises you have made. These include your plan to amass a deportation force to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants; ban the entry of Muslims into our country and aggressively surveil them; punish women for accessing abortion; reauthorize waterboarding and other forms of torture; and change our libel laws and restrict freedom of expression. These proposals are not simply un-American and wrong-headed, they are unlawful and unconstitutional. They violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. If you do not reverse course and instead endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality, you will have to contend with the full firepower of the ACLU at every step. Our staff of litigators and activists in every state, thousands of volunteers, and millions of card-carrying supporters are ready to fight against any encroachment on our cherished freedoms and rights.

6939|Jewish Press Releases Audio Tape Exposing Hillary Clinton Plotting to Rig Election|Decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. The presidential candidate lamented that the US determine who was going to win. I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win, she said. Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the office in Brooklyn. Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy, but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed existence and espoused violence. That day in September 2006, Clinton made odd and controversial comments, all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky held onto all these years. I went to my bosses at the time, Chomsky told the Observer. The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody even a direct quote from anyone in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.

Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Google Inc reported this information. Brand was the first Google Israel employee and was appointed CEO of Google Israel. At the same time Meir Brand will continue to rule Israel, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, Turkey, and Greece. Against the background of the latest Wikileaks data about rigging custom queries of Google and Yahoo in favor of Clinton and other assistance provided by the corporation of the Democratic Party headquarters (also financing by Israeli billionaires), the appointment of Meir Brand means the strengthening Israel's role in the information space. Despite the fact that Google has apologized for the changes on their maps (Palestine, for example, has not been marked as autonomy one, there was no Serbian monastery of Visoki Dečani), Tel Aviv is known to use actively possibilities of censorship in Internet. The recent changes are likely aimed to an active information attack including at strategically important areas, with which Meir Brand is familiar (Russia, Turkey, Middle Eastern countries).

Margarita: Not many (probably) remember that the largely successful effort to gut tort laws around the country started in mid-80s by insurance companies, after they lost money in the early 1980s real estate boom/bust. Not satisfied with the current tepid tort laws, they are at it again. And Adam Levitin via e-mail: I love that the arbitration is getting priced. This is a great example of what tried to teach in contracts for years: the law only looks at the one-off contract. But the insurer give a shit about the individual contract. all actuarial tables. And that creates a total mismatch. The consumer is a one time player, while the insurer is a repeat player. The consumer will rationally value the arbitration clause at basically nothing an optimism bias one gets married thinking that going to get divorced), because the odds of it being important are so low and only one contract. But because the insurer is doing multiple contracts, even low odds matter. As a result consumers will never properly price for arbitration clauses and the like.

6979|US Drone Pilots May Be ‘Illegally’ Acquiring Targets From UK Bases|"US Drone Pilots May Be Acquiring Targets From UK Bases Source: Motherboard Creech Air Force Base , Nevada, is widely known to be the heart of the United overseas drone operations, from where more than 100 drone flights per day in the Middle controlled. Notions of this overworked drone pilots, sitting in stuffy trailers monitoring and killing targets 8,000 miles away, have been popularized by movies such as Good Kill and Eye in the Sky. But a British human rights campaign group says it has uncovered documents that show the US is also conducting its military drone operations from within Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in the UK, an act that would be deemed in breach of international laws , argues the group. The British government denies this however, stating , the US does not operate RPAS [remotely piloted aircraft systems] from the UK. Publicly available job listings and résumés, shown to Motherboard by human rights campaign group Reprieve, show that US military personnel based in the UK have been working on drone missions at RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire near London. Another job ad is looking for a targeting analyst to work at Molesworth for conducting thorough analysis on traditional and non-traditional targets for the purposes of creating electronic target folders for nation state and non-state actor systems. A further job ad from private military contractor Leidos is looking for a video intelligence analyst to be based at Molesworth. While the Molesworth base belongs to the RAF, parts of it are currently leased to the US for its European intelligence analysis operations, known as the Joint Analysis Center. US operations at Molesworth are in fact currently preparing to merge with operations at Croughton RAF base, where a $160 million US operations center will be established . ""The British Government has questions to answer"" Simply to say that drones are not flown from the UK is missing the point, if it is personnel on British soil that are at the top of the so-called and British agencies who are feeding targets into those lists, said Jennifer Gibson, staff attorney at Reprieve. The US drone programme, conducted in the shadows, has killed hundreds of civilians without any accountability. The British Government has questions to answer over its own involvement in this secret war and how much responsibility it bears for those deaths."|2022-10-03 09:00:00|FAKE|Ava Murphy|Metro News|625414|21907|256|5039|Vietnam|English|2022-09-13 21:00:00|Crítica|0|True|1087200|2772000|2372|4.266666666666667

CAROL COSTELLO: So talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down? JONATHAN GRUBER: Look, once again, no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs, points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool stupid Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage in selling it.|2022-09-19 13:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|Express Tribune|517387|54774|78|1554|Mexico|English|2022-09-16 10:00:00|Reseña|0|True|1306800|1576800|1659|1.3

Michael Roache, 43, is said to be suffering from a rare form of temporary psychosis, which forces him to repeat himself continually for its duration. It started after he arrived home last night, wife Deirdre Roache recalls, I thought nothing of it until this morning, when I found him staring at the ceiling in bed, murmuring the same thing over and over again: get over the amount of kids in here'. Worried, the mother of children immediately called her local care doctor, who in turn referred him to a psychiatric unit for further testing. It is understood the self-employed man was overwhelmed when he entered the popular nightclub in the city centre, triggering something in his head and sending him into a loop. He kept saying over and over again that he get over the amount of kids in the place, friend Dermot Ryan told WWN, who is also way too old for night clubs, We just went in for a late drink because we were working late. be the last time I go into that fucking place. I felt so old. Mr. Roache is currently being treated for verbal looping at the psychiatric unit, and doctors have suggested temporarily moving him to an old folks home in a bid to him out of This kind of thing is common in the over Dr. Kevin Maher explained, Hopefully an hour or two in the old folks home will neutralize his psychosis.

Since then she's gone on to a glorious career of representing the Castro regime at the UN. Or is it the Obama regime. It naturally gets confusing when the US Ambassador to the UN sides with the enemy against her own country. ""For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you."" Under Obama, Power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the United States. And they say Obama is some sort of anti-American traitor. I don't see it. If he were, we would be seeing signs of it by now. Anyway, Power then went on to audition for the job of the UN ambassador from Cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal Communist dictatorship about our human rights are well-founded... ""Let me be among the first to acknowledge as our Cuban counterparts often point out that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust."" Somehow though siding with Communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust. Only opposing the left does."|2022-09-21 01:00:00|FAKE|Alexander Lee|Insider Insights|658358|23817|292|2317|France|English|2022-09-06 01:00:00|Columna|1|True|410400|1706400|1750|4.866666666666666

7035|Terror Tots: We Must Prepare for the Child-Fighters of ISIS|0 comments There are thousands of children who live under ISIS control and they are training them to kill and terrorize. They are teaching them to blow people up and shoot them. These ISIS children are becoming suicide bombers and they are executing people. Many have yet to reach puberty. Throughout history, evil has taken advantage of the innocence and pliability of children. ISIS has taken that to the extreme. This video will tear your heart in half and make you angry at the same time. If these children come to our shores, what do we do? How do we deal with this insanity? children have proven to be effective weapons. ISIS is extremely organized in the preparation of these children. The Observer reports : While they learn the deadly art of warfare, the children are also schooled in the three and ISIS runs a network of schools that the children attend. A Foreign Affairs piece by Mia Bloom attests to two schools that cater to English-speaking students. Some of the children are local, but many of them are foreigners, that is, not born and bred in Syria, Iraq or Yemen. The kids come from all over the world and the schools are set up to teach them in their native languages. They come from all over including China and Kazakhstan, from Belgium and Germany and England and the US. They even come from Israel. ISIS figured it out without our help. Children play a very large role in their own propaganda and recruiting materials. They also play central roles in their activity. Highly trained kids are referred to by ISIS elders as their cubs. These cubs are the crème de la crème. We face a religion of evil. It is not a religion of peace.These men are pure evil and this latest tactic proves such. I hope those in our government are thinking of how to deal with these children if they ever reach our shores.

Trump with Election Day just a week away. {snip} The reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical, with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play. In North Carolina, where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an almost surgical assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early-voting sites, black turnout is down 16 percent . White turnout, however, is up 15 percent. Democrats are planning an aggressive final push, including a visit by President Obama to the state on Wednesday. But in Florida, which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012, share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased , to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago. The problems for Democrats do not end there. In Ohio, which also cut back its early voting, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down, though the Clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on Sunday when African-American churches led voter drives across the state. {snip} The Clinton campaign believes it can close the gap, especially in North Carolina and Florida, by Election Day. And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and college-educated women, which have the potential to more than make up for any drop-off in black voting. {snip}|2022-09-26 09:00:00|FAKE|Samantha Chen|Voice of the Nation|109874|27044|272|3394|Spain|English|2022-09-18 18:00:00|Carta al editor|0|True|2167200|1508400|1848|4.533333333333333

This image of a 16-year-old migrant crying which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian is nothing short of laughable.

The image is placed under a headline reading: Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais. This crying child is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow children like him into their nation. The image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically.

At least 35 people were arrested, police said. Even as there was no room to move, police officers continued to push protesters and reporters, with some toppling over in the fray. Police pepper-sprayed several protesters. In a message to the San Diego Police Department, Trump applauded the officers' response to the protesters. ""Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally,"" Trump tweeted. ""Greatly appreciated."" Some protesters sitting in a public square refused to move as police officers in riot gear moved in, leading to several arrests.

As the situation intensified at moments, with several volleys of bottles being tossed between the sides, police officers moved in, forcefully and at times aggressively pushing back Trump supporters, protesters and media caught in the scrum with their batons. But while some violent altercations did break out, the two sides mostly shouted and chanted at each other. Protesters, some of whom waved Mexican flags, shouted ""F--- Trump"" and immigration-focused slogans.

7054|Mavs Fans Got Mad At Mark Cuban For Bashing Trump. His Response Is Perfect|Comments Mark Cuban has been vocally outspoken about the 2016 election after learning the dark truth about Republican nominee Donald Trump. Initially, Cuban actually supported candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual, but as he (and we all) learned more about the dark past of The dirty dealings , sexual predations and more, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena, culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate. Cuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his anti-Trump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise. Mark Cuban probably, literally dropped the mic after this response: You know what, when all said and done, rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And so if it means we play to empty arenas, down with that. Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I know,. heard it from both. had people say no way I can support you. I go to another Mavs And had people say know what? buying Mavs What heard more often than anything is, you gonna be this way once the And the answer is no. known me forever Newy and been apolitical my entire adult life and only because I know Donald and I know my feelings about what he would be like as president have I gotten this involved but come November 9, all Mavs all the time. Mark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena, which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank short term health. Luckily, Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA, which is far and away most progressive major sports league, which guarantee ongoing success, but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred.|2022-09-20 15:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Chronicle|987265|89931|413|8127|Bangladesh|English|2022-09-16 09:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|1670400|1303200|1945|6.883333333333334

But not all done there have also been more death threats and calls to violence. Former Congressman Joe Walsh, who, like Donald Trump, enjoys Twitter WAY more than he should, tweeted this on November 1: Another shocking GOP turn is from Ted Cruz, who just a few short months ago, during his speech at the RNC, refused to endorse Trump, but just today he hopped on plane to go campaign for him in Iowa. This, after Trump accused father of killing JFK and also said horrible things about his wife. Remember that baked bean teeth comment Trump made? Yeah. Just plain nasty. really unfortunate that Cruz caved, but the GOP is so terrified of losing control, that they are willing to forget their own pride and pull out all the stops to keep Clinton out of office.

7068|If You Live HERE, Forget Christmas Lights – They’ve Been BANNED to Avoid “Offending Refugees”|0 comments Perhaps no country has been more welcoming of Muslims refugees to their own detriment than Sweden. Not only has the country accepted far more of these migrants than they can feasibly handle, but the nation has also bent over backwards to make them comfortable. Things have gotten so out of hand that Christmas lights have now been banned so as not to offend these devout Muslims. The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages this year, which means that many towns will have no lights at all for the holiday. What a sad time for the native Christians in Sweden. To add insult to injury, Speisa called the decision a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the Christian traditions. Shockingly, even though the onslaught of Islamic culture has wreaked havoc on people and infrastructure, they want to tone down the Christian influence. How backwards is that?! Authorities appear to be trying to sweep the decision under the rug by claiming it is a matter of safety. Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there, said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. not sure going to be fooling anyone with this safety line. If they were really so worried about that, they be allowing millions of migrants to roam around raping their women and children. MRC Blog expressed the same sentiment: This argument that lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk is complete [sic] bogus, of course. Authorities in Sweden actually expect people to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. In reality, these lights have simply been banned to avoid offending Muslim refugees. You can be sure that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we have a future similar to to look forward to. She has privately expressed her desire for completely open borders and she kowtows to Muslims the same way President Obama does. SHARE this report if you think it is utterly absurd that Sweden has banned Christmas lights to appease Muslim refugees!|2022-10-10 18:00:00|FAKE|Ethan Hayes|The Informer|449328|50321|74|879|United States|English|2022-10-06 14:00:00|Noticia internacional|1|True|3049200|3409200|2215|1.2333333333333334

Information that Lord Malloch-Brown, Director General of a company which produces election technology and voting machine, has close partnership relations with global fraudster and speculator George Soros, occurred in the US media in mid-October. And it was the last straw for the Americans. It's also confirmed implicitly by the fact that Soros himself has stood for Hillary Clinton many times. A famous financier of colour revolutions makes everything possible not to let Donald Trump come to power, as the latter has claimed several times that in case he won, he would cease policy of 'implanting democracy' in other countries. Taking into account sorrowful experience of the Soros' structures in the post-Soviet countries as well as those in the Central and Eastern Europe, these relations really allow to seriously suspect the financier and sponsor of colour revolutions of attempts to influence unbiased will of the American citizens. There has been no reaction to the petition so far, however Administration of the US president has been caught several times in deleting 'unwanted' petitions and signatures.

7082|IRONY ALERT: First Person Arrested For Voter Fraud Is A Trump Supporter|IRONY ALERT: First Person Arrested For Voter Fraud Is A Trump Supporter By Andrew Bradford on October 29, 2016 Subscribe Ever since the public opinion polls began showing him behind in the 2016 race for the White House, GOP nominee Donald Trump has alleged that the political system and election is rigged. He has even recommended that his supporters show up at polling places to observe what is taking place and assure the election stolen via voter fraud. Which brings us to Thursday in Des Moines, Iowa. Terri Lynn Rote voted early at an election office in her hometown. A few hours later, Rote then went to another polling location and attempted to vote a second time. She was arrested and charged with first-degree election fraud, a Class D felony. The irony is almost too much to stomach, it? Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald said the first time in 12 years he can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud to the authorities. What Trump and other Republicans fail to say when they warn of voter fraud on the left is that based on the demographics of the American electorate, there is no need for Democrats to try and commit fraud when it comes to a national election. In fact, it is far more likely that the GOP will have to try to cheat or intimidate voters (with restrictive voter ID provisions and by cutting back the number of polling places or early voting days) in order to remain competitive. It should also be noted that when Trump was winning in the Republican primaries, you never once heard him scream about anyone trying to cheat or rig an election. It was only after his own numbers began to slip and he found himself behind by as much at 14 points to Hillary Clinton that such talk began. So, Donald, what say you about the election being rigged in light of Terri Rote? Donald? that silence tells us all we need to know. the Donald alleging that the election is rigged against him: Featured Image Via Des Moines Police Dept.

7106|Israeli Deputy Minister: Italy Quakes Retribution For Anti Jewish Vote|Edmondo Burr in Conspiracies // 0 Comments The two earthquakes that hit Italy Wednesday were retribution for the support of a UNESCO resolution that disregards the Jewish connection to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, according to Israeli Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara (Likud). Israel suspended its ties with the UN cultural agency after it adopted a draft resolution this month, that Israel says denies connections to the holiest sites. The deputy minister, who was in Italy when the earthquakes struck, ascribed the natural disasters to divine will. RT.com reports: sure that the earthquake happened because of the UNESCO decision, Kara, a member of the ruling Likud Party, wrote in a memo, Ynetnews website reported. Ironically, the Israeli politician was on a state visit to the Vatican when the quakes hit central Italy on Wednesday, killing one and injuring 10 people. Earlier the same day, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), passed a resolution criticizing Israel for its handling of the holy site in Jerusalem called Temple Mount by Jews, and Haram al-Sharif by Muslims. The document was adopted after heated debate over its wording, and particularly the Arabic names used in the document. Italy was among the nations voting in favor of the resolution. Israel blasted UNESCO and its Arab members for trying to undermine Jewish connections to the holy site. Kara arrived in the Vatican in a fruitless effort to avert the resolution, but still managed to have a small chat with the leader of the Catholic Church. According to Kara, Pope Francis strongly disagreed with the resolution. He (the Pope) even said publicly that the holy land is connected to the Nation of Israel, the deputy minister stressed. As for surviving the natural disaster, the Israeli politician said that going through the earthquake was not the most comfortable of experiences, but we trusted that the Holy See would keep us safe.|2022-10-09 02:00:00|FAKE|Emily Parker|World News Network|353339|41478|163|5658|Indonesia|English|2022-09-02 19:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|129600|3265200|1945|2.716666666666667

Military Veterans Are Helping To Save Coral Reefs By Combating Climate Change By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 27, 2016 Veterans Are Helping To Save Coral Reefs Find Your Job Now at HireVeterans.com By Ken Silverstein At a time when the presidential election is dividing families and friends, at least one issue is bridging the gap: giving veterans of the U.S. military a new lease on life by teaching them how to restore coral reefs. And they are trying to enlist big business as their ally. Indeed, the marriage of the ecology along with those who have served their nation is breathing a new spirit into the coral reefs, which make up a whole community of living organisms that survive on the ocean floor. Those reefs just a thing of beauty. They are also an economic engine, spawning entire enterprises that range from tourism to medicine, including the making of drugs that deal with cancer, arthritis and bacterial infections. Our guys are special forces who are physically strong but who are also struggling, says Jim Ritterhoff, founder of Force Blue that combines the virtues of military training with coral reef restoration.

(Photo: Kristina Barker / The New York Times) The stand-off between the Standing Rock Sioux and the Dakota Access pipeline shows no sign of letting up. Indigenous opponents of the four-state, nearly $4 billion dollar pipeline have set up another encampment. Members of the Great Sioux Nation say they are invoking eminent domain over land rightfully theirs under an 1851 treaty; and have situated their Winter Camp directly in the path of the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners, developers of the massive pipeline that would run beneath the Missouri River, says the land belongs to the company after they recently purchased the tract from a farmer. According to the Morton County Department, six states have deployed law enforcement officers to the area. Tuesday night in a Facebook post, the department said private security hired by Energy Transfer Partners who unleashed attack dogs and pepper spray on protesters in early September were not licensed and could face prosecution. Hundreds of people have been arrested during months of protest; most on minor trespass charges. Yet many have been subjected to strip searches and jailed.

No Obama accomplishment will remain. They even have a name for the plan: The First Day Project. Organized by the Heritage Foundation, the goal is to deprive Obama of any lasting effect to his time in office. a perverse sort of vengeance from a group of clowns who have spent the last decade smearing the president at every possible step of the way. Trump aides are organizing what one Republican close to the campaign calls the First Day Project. Trump spends several hours signing erases the Obama Presidency, he said. Stephen Moore, an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained, We want to identify maybe twenty-five executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office. Thinking back over list of wins from gay rights to healthcare to the economy the idea that these achievements can be erased by a collective of spiteful, bitter men in a matter of hours is almost too much to bear. The suffering to the people whose rights will surely be rolled back will be immense. And on a separate, but equally terrifying front, campaign surrogate Omarosa told reporters that Trump has been compiling an enemies an assortment of people on the right and left who openly stood against him and he plans on punishing those on the list when he gets to office. I would never judge anybody for exercising their right to and the freedom to choose who they want. But let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and keeping a list.

Sheer, stomach-churning panic. You see, up until now I had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the unimaginable: Donald Trump winning. But as election day looms closer, and the racism and sexism that infects campaign is ratcheted up, hard not to be terrified. In the past week, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper endorsed Trump and white supremacists announced their plan for widespread voter intimidation. Trump rally-goers shouted antisemitic invective at reporters, and a historically black church in Mississippi was burned and vote Trump scrawled across the side. Another woman came forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault , and a Texas official called Hillary Clinton a cunt. This a political divide between left and right, Democrats and Republicans; an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why been easier for many horrified by Trump to simply pretend no way that he could actually win the presidency.

Russian troops will participate in war games in Serbia while NATO is conducting military drills in Montenegro, media reported on Monday. Russian 13-day military exercise in Serbia is named The Slavic Brotherhood 2016 and begins on Wednesday. It will include 150 Russian paratroopers, 50 air force staffers, three transport planes and an unspecified number of troops from Serbia and Belarus, Defense Ministry said. The five-day NATO drill in Montenegro started on Monday and involves responding to floods and chemical attacks. It will involve 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO countries and 10 partner states. In the past both Serbia and Montenegro were constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Both countries are socialist republics and traditional Russian Christian Orthodox allies. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into Serbia and Montenegro, and in 2006 the two became independent states. Since their split, the two Balkan neighbors seem to have headed in different directions strategically. Montenegro has taken a pro-Western stance which has been awarded by NATO with an offer to join the Northern Atlantic Alliance. The NATO invitation to Montenegro has met strong opposition from Russia. Meanwhile, Montenegrin officials have accused Russia of staging an alleged coup in October to topple its pro-Western government because of the NATO accession bid. Serbia, a NATO partner, has held exercises with the Western alliance, but not such a large one or with foreign troops and equipment participating on its soil.|2022-09-14 01:00:00|FAKE|Caleb Shah|Central Times|69751|68675|183|3048|Uganda|English|2022-09-12 05:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|943200|1101600|1732|3.05

With just 10 easy steps, anyone can roll the perfect but enjoy responsibly! Step 1: Fill the tub. Step 2: Get the dark fruit, the bush that grows in the shadow of the valley of the shadow of weed, the hiccup, the liquid daydream fresh from the ice-cube tray, the wisdom tooth of the vegetables ogre, Israeli nightshade, the Arizona iced tea of drugs, the dad baffler, the sweet teen poison, the sickly crop of the wind farm, the flower the devil dares not of your fridge. Set it aside. Step 3: A filter keeps fire from squirming into your throat and laying its eggs in your brainstem. Build the filter by pouring a mixture of egg whites and ground hen bones into a filter mold, and leave it at your house over a long weekend to set. Step 4: Get your rolling paper by stripping a few inches of skin off the Paper Wretch with a hot carrot peeler. It may take a few tries to get a good swath! Step 5: To break up the weed, place it on an active fault line in a bowl full of gravel. Step 6: Once a major tectonic event has ground your weed, pound it into a paste using a book about a curious incident. Step 7: Wrap your index finger in paper and feed the weed paste into your port. A chilly sensation means your body has accepted the paste and will pass it on. A prickling sensation means your body has rejected the paste and will hopefully pee it out someday. Step 8: Seal the joint by licking your papered-up finger like a naughty little thing. filthy, you? Step 9: Remove finger, twist paper, and voilà! The perfect joint for any mouth. Step 10: Dunk the joint in the tub so you tempted to smoke it and become insane. Start over at step one! get discouraged if you get it right on the first try. Like all things in life, practice makes perfect!|2022-10-08 06:00:00|FAKE|Olivia Kumar|The Informer|810602|39620|257|3634|Mexico|English|2022-10-07 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|3099600|3193200|1896|4.283333333333333

Fifteen-year-old Taylor Hutton has known that gay for as long as he can remember, and over the past few months been working up the courage to finally tell his friends and family the truth. Taylor even planned to film some of those moments and post them on YouTube, in hopes that they might help other kids going through a similar experience. But just when this teen was ready to stop hiding who he really is, something incredible happened: Donald Trump and Mike Pence were elected into the White House, and Taylor just got another four years to plan his viral coming-out video! Um, luckiest teen ever? Up until now, Taylor figured just prop his iPhone up to record the moment he came out to his parents, but after watching the presidential election results come in last night, Taylor knew that he needed to scrap that plan immediately. This lucky teen now has until at least 2020 before he can safely come out of the closet, and more than enough time to come up with the sort of next-level viral video idea that could seriously break the internet! Instead of releasing some half-baked, hastily edited video on his YouTube channel this spring, Taylor will now get to spend at least the next four years of a Trump/Pence administration dreaming up the most heartwarming and totally shareable coming-out video imaginable. And depending on how the next election goes, this kid just might get the chance to keep brainstorming camera angles and staging options in his head until well into his mid-20s or older. So awesome! With cameras only getting better and better, possible that four years from now even get to witness Taylor finally arrive at some sort of peace with himself in stunning, crystal-clear 8K resolution. Best of luck to you over the next four years, Taylor! We wait for you to release that coming-out video as soon as doing so put you under immediate danger from your own government.

Generally, the Bureau does NOT publicly reveal that someone is under investigation, never mind someone who is so high-profile, like an active candidate for President! So the revelation that the Hillary investigation is now re-opened is an absolute stunner on many levels. Frankly, all experts agree that it must be something extraordinary they found; something likely criminal. Adding to the drama was that the FBI Director did NOT coordinate the announcement with the White House or with the Department of Justice (DOJ) - which could be an effort by the Bureau to regain its lost reputation for Integrity. Keeping the White house and Justice Department out of the loop means they could not interfere prior to the announcement, and now that the announcement has been made publicly, neither the White House nor the DOJ can prevent the public from knowing something big is taking place. ""DEVASTATING REVELATIONS"" And ""big"" might be an understatement. Late Friday night, the White House very quietly CANCELED all of Barack Obama's scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton! The scheduled events, confirmed for months, were all quietly DELETED. See the Before and After images below: Whatever information the FBI has found must be completely devastating for Clinton. So devastating, that President Obama can no longer even be seen as supporting her candidacy! This FBI announcement has ""criminality"" written all over it. Stay tuned."|2022-10-08 21:00:00|FAKE|Noah Khan|Global Gazette|184337|66584|208|7683|United States|English|2022-09-14 03:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3247200|1108800|1805|3.466666666666667

One must be cautions when dwelling in the shadows of the uncanny realm which could scar your soul for eternity. The thought of encountering a ghost can be exciting and scary, although there are some extreme cases of spiritual contact that can cause not only mental, but also physical damage. Even worse than encountering a ghost, is being in contact with cursed objects. In this case we're talking about a specific statue on Oakland Cemetary, Iowa City, which is called the ""Black Angel"" . This statue is said to hold a death curse, so who ever dares to touch it will die in a very short amount of time, sometimes right on the spot. It is unknown about the true origin of the curse, but there are several different stories. There are also disturbing accounts of people dying after touching the statue.

Well, ok, but where were they during the past sixteen years during which America has been dragged by inches into becoming the proto-facist state it now is?

And where is it written in the US constitution that they justify the reversal of an election? And what about those alt news types supporting the protesters? Do they agree with Change.org that the vote should be overturned by the electoral college and Clinton given the presidency because she has a vagina and her chums can mobilise mass-hysteria? Are they basically saying they were for Hillary all along, because the Pentagon and Wall Street and WW3 are the lesser of two evils? If not what they are saying, then what?

The Woman Who Accused Trump of Raping Her at 13 Just Dropped Her Lawsuit By GPD on November 4, 2016 Bloom said earlier this week that Doe/Johnson appear at a planned press conference because she had received death threats and was in fear for her life. Illustration by Jim Cooke A woman who accused Donald Trump of raping her at a party when she was just 13 years old has voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit, according to court records. The woman, who has gone by the pseudonyms Jane Doe and Katie Johnson, was a no-show at a much hyped press conference earlier this week with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom. Jezebel previously detailed the bizarre backstory behind two lawsuits Johnson filed against Trump and celebrity sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who she said also raped her at a party in 1994. A group of men worked for a year to push the rape allegations into the news, while preventing access to Johnson. No journalist has ever been able to speak to her directly in person or confirm her existence. However, her attorney, Thomas Francis Meagher of New Jersey, has told Jezebel met with his client on several occasions and has gotten to know her quite well. According to court records, Johnson/Doe voluntarily dismissed the suit on the afternoon of November 4. No other information is provided in the filing.

Trump passed the 1,237 mark after unbound delegates from North Dakota, Colorado and Pennsylvania pledged their support for him. NBC News declared the real estate mogul to be the presumptive Republican nominee after his remaining GOP competitors dropped out of the race in early May. Trump will not officially become the nominee until he accepts the nomination at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July. Earlier in the race, Trump foes within the Republican Party hoped to prevent him from reaching the so-called ""magic number"" of a majority of delegates, forcing a contested nomination process that would have prompted a potentially chaotic power struggle between different factions of the GOP on the convention floor. But Trump deflated the hopes of rivals like Ted Cruz and John Kasich after decisively winning the Indiana primary on May 3 and putting himself easily within reach of a majority of delegates before the end of the primary process."|2022-10-07 01:00:00|REAL|Victoria Singh|Press Pulse|320412|38559|242|5516|Spain|English|2022-10-01 22:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|3088800|2646000|1120|4.033333333333333

There were 2,333,539 gun-related checks processed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS, last month, according to FBI documents posted on Monday. That represents an increase of more than 350,000 checks over the previous October, itself a record. also the 18th month in a row to set a record. With two months to go, 2016 has already seen 22,206,233 NICS checks, making it the second highest year for checks in the history of NICS with only 2015 seeing more . NICS checks are considered to be one of the most accurate indicators for gun sales because nearly all sales made through federally licensed firearm dealers require a check by law. The number of NICS checks in a month do not represent an exact count of gun sales for a number of reasons. For instance, many states require a NICS checks for those applying for gun carry permits, and many states do not require NICS checks for sales between private parties. These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS, the FBI said. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.

Talking to supporters, Strache argued the uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely. Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, will be there for all Austrians in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the recent election posters carry the phrase so help me God a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. Vienna must not become Istanbul He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan. It reads: God cannot be instrumentalised for own intentions or for political purposes. We consider that mentioning to attack other religions and cultures indirectly amounts to an abuse of his name and religion in general. The Freedom Party claim Hofer used the rallying phrase as it came directly from the heart and is strongly anchored in Christian and Western values which the party holds. Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered.

The scientific study, carried out by a team of genetic experts at Trinity College Dublin, found that the majority of Irish males aged between 16-30 have grown a lot weaker physically and less resilient to cold temperatures over the past 60 years. Of 100 Irish males tested in physical work environments, 67% percent moaned about being tired and fatigued after just two minutes. We put the study group to work on a local farm picking spuds, weeding gardens and doing general old time shit, lead researcher Professor Conor Tracey explains, We even made them travel to work in their bare feet. The results we got back were absolutely appalling to tell you the truth. Only a small minority of the men got on with their chores without complaining. In fact, further testing found that 89% of those studied were a trait increasing in modern day males. Nearly every one of them began whinging about the cold during the picking stones in the frost task, Dr. Tracey added, They began complaining that their ikkle fingies were sore, and that they feel their hands or feet from the cold. Poor pets. Several lads even tried to pretend they were sick in a bid to get out of the job, and one 18-year-old subject began crying for his mammy like a big baby, so he did. The study concluded that 92% of Irish men were found to be made of nothing these days, compared to the young fellas of years ago who used to walk to school in their bare feet, before then going to work in the mines for 18 hours a day.|2022-10-05 23:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Newsflash|793637|61163|263|6133|Mexico|English|2022-09-22 22:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|2995200|1868400|1773|4.383333333333334

The only billboards are propaganda for the dictatorship, with the faces of Fidel or Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. You hear on the radio again and again in 1958, or since the Revolution, followed by news on Venezuela: monopolization of private supermarkets of the right and their international to public policies of the Venezuelan has Money is the key factor determining how a person is treated. If you are a foreigner, things are great, given that apart from having money, the regime forces Cubans to try to make a good impression though it is difficult to pretend. The government behaves as if foreigners were royalty and Cubans were commoners. The same happens with Cuban-Americans who fled the island and return to visit, because they come back with purchasing power. Cubans work for practically nothing. The average salary for a Cuban is US $20. A nurse earns $40 per month. A teacher earns $20 per month and a doctor earns $60 per month. There are two markets in Cuba: the Cuban peso market and the dollar market. The dollar market has decent products, while poor quality products are valued in Cuban pesos. With the salary of a Cuban, the possibilities are limited to buying products in pesos, because only foreigners can buy products in dollars. Usually, when one goes to the market looking for a food item, it is not available. Sellers say they might have it tomorrow, but they rarely do. Other times, sellers do not have any money for giving change to the customers, or no packaging like napkins, plates, cups, bags, etc. Each family has its own sales control for food items book, which indicates the amount of food that families can buy from the government. Often, they are the only things accessible and reasonably priced for a Cuban salary. Fruits, vegetables and meat are not part of the Cuban peso system, so not everyone gets to enjoy such things. The sales control book only includes rice, beans, sugar, coffee and pasta. Together, they still enough to form a healthy diet.

Labrador Wayne Hayes refuses to eat normal dog biscuits, preferring a discontinued American 80s brand of dog food called Chunkiez that his owners have to buy off the internet at vast expense. Hayes said: all about Chunkiez Beefy Mix because the box they come in has such a cool design aesthetic. It just speaks to my vibe. I realise £17 a box because they stopped making it in 1984 and only one warehouse in Canada that has stock, but like everything in my life paid for by my parents.

Wolf a bill that would block public officials from immediately releasing the names of officers involved in such incidents. The measure, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Martina White of Philadelphia and approved by the GOP-controlled legislature, stoked sharp opinions and drew votes largely along partisan lines. Supporters say the bill, supported by several local police unions, is necessary to protect police officers and their families after such incidents. We are the protectors of our protectors, said one proponent, Rep. Dominic Costa, a Pittsburgh De mocrat. Opponents said the bill flies in the face of transparency, which they believe is even more critical in tragic circumstances involving police shootings. Do not undermine the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color, said Rep. Margo Davidson (D., Delaware) during a floor debate.

Declassified FBI documents reveal that the technology actually exists and was hidden from the public after his death. Via UsualRoutine Published after 73 years of being kept from the public, the declassified documents vindicate conspiracy theorists. They claim that many of innovations were far ahead of his time but were suppressed by the mainstream scientists. According to Sputnik News, Russia has developed a unique radio-electronic weapon to disable enemy drones. The device will soon enter service with the Russian Armed Forces. This is according to a United Instrument Corporation (UIC) spokesman. Natsionalnaya Oborona (National Defense) journal editor-on-chief Igor Korotchenko revealed that the test unit uses ultrahigh frequency impulses to disable aircraft electronics. Similar to the effects of an EMP burst, it renders them useless in a combat environment. Russia Unveils New Weapon, Based On Nikola Death Ray? With its effective range apparently not exceeding one kilometer, this weapon may be used against UAVs flying right above the battlefield, Korotchenko also added that similar weapons were currently being developed not just in Russia but also in the US and other countries. Alexander Perendzhiyev, a military political analyst said that the weapon can be used not just against aircraft but against all systems with microelectronic elements. The new weapon is especially effective when used against devices with hi-tech microelectronic systems frying their circuits. According to Your News Wire, there are currently no details suggesting that Nikola death ray was the basis of the new Russian weapon. There are many who believe that the famous inventor created weapons of mass destruction. However the majority of work involved those for domestic use. Most notable these is the Alternating Current or AC. For now, the declassified FBI documents reveal nothing except that the death ray is in fact real and not just a figment of imagination. Franklin D. Vice President, Henry Wallace, mentioned in the declassified FBI records as having advisers discuss its effects.

Gulf residents of variety of species are paying a high price for it so high that litigation against BP for its role in the spill, officially deemed negligent , is likely to continue for decades as people fight to get help with ongoing medical expenses. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the spill was linked to an uptick in dolphin deaths , illustrating that this unprecedented release of petroleum products in the Gulf had a lasting health impact for animals. Similarly, abnormalities in heart development among fish have also been connected to Deepwater Horizon exposure. Part of the problem is that sediments remain coated in oil and sludge . Because it was impossible to clean up every drop of crude from the Gulf, the oil that settled to the bottom continues to interfere with the embryonic development of a range of fish species. But humans doing too well either. In the aftermath of the spill, people were exposed both to crude petroleum and to Corexit , a chemical dispersant used in unprecedented volumes during the cleanup. Subsequent research has shown that in addition to having some hazardous health effects on its own, the combination of Corexit and the type of crude spilled during the Deepwater Horizon incident packs a hefty punch for marine animals. In the weeks following the spill, first responders reported symptoms like rashes, respiratory problems, headaches, seizures and depression. In response to the complains, agencies closely monitored these individuals. As the years went by, enough significant health problems arose for a class action lawsuit against BP.

726|Trump Willing to Meet N.Korea's Kim, Wants to Renegotiate Paris Climate Accord|"In a wide-ranging discussion, Trump also said he disapproved of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in eastern Ukraine, called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord, and said he would dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations if he is elected president. The presumptive Republican nominee declined to share details of his plans to deal with North Korea, but a meeting with Kim would mark a major shift in U.S. policy towards the isolated nation. ""I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,"" Trump said of Kim. ""At the same time I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China,"" he said in the half-hour interview at his Trump Tower office in Manhattan. China is Pyongyang's only major diplomatic and economic supporter. Trump said the United States is treated unfairly in the Paris climate accord, which prescribes reductions in carbon emissions by more than 170 countries. A renegotiation of the pact would be a major setback for what was hailed as the first truly global climate accord, committing both rich and poor nations to reining in the rise in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for warming the planet. Turning to the economy, Trump said he planned to release a detailed policy platform in two weeks. He said it would dismantle nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms put in place after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. ""I would say it'll be close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank is a very negative force, which has developed a very bad name,"" Trump said. The New York billionaire also said he perceived a dangerous financial bubble within the tech startup industry. He said tech companies were attaining high valuations without ever making money. Trump also said he eventually wants a Republican to head the U.S. Federal Reserve, but said he is ""not an enemy"" of current chair Janet Yellen. ""I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point,"" he said, adding that inflation ""doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon."|2022-09-08 19:00:00|REAL|Jacob Gupta|Sunrise Chronicle|79674|59616|294|4214|Spain|English|2022-09-01 09:00:00|Editorial|0|True|648000|7200|2178|4.9
7266|THIS Is What It Means If You Have Two Dimples On Your Back|posted by Eddie Whether you have back dimples, or not, you have to admit that they are quite an interesting characteristic. These back dimples are also called the of and are more commonly found on women. Theses dimples of Venus, officially named Lateral Lumbar indentations, are caused by ligaments pulling under the skin of your back and creating indentations. One of the most intriguing things about this trait is that it can reveal certain things about your health and even yourself. In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, there is some research that claims women with these back dimples can reach climax more easily during intimate activities. There a lot of scientific evidence that supports the claim, but it is explained by the unique shape and placement of your pelvis and your backbone. The way your muscles and bones are positioned in your body can help improve circulation, which could increase your chances of a release. While there needs to be more research done before any of these claims can be confirmed, at this moment there seem to be no possible risks or health problems associated with having these back dimples. Additionally, back dimples come in all different shapes and sizes. Their appearance varies greatly from person to person depending on their weight, body shape, and athletic ability. It is also unlikely for men to have these back dimples. However, if you do have back dimples, they can be enhanced by doing certain exercises focused on engaging your lower back and core muscles, which will be good for the overall health of your body, and perfect for making your back dimples more noticeable. You could even get piercings on each of them if really wanting to show them off. source:|2022-09-23 12:00:00|FAKE|Lucas Kim|City Times|43469|43367|59|5928|Colombia|English|2022-09-01 09:00:00|Crítica|0|True|1918800|7200|1719|0.9833333333333333
7268|Former US Attorney for DC: New Hillary Email Probe Was Result of ‘Revolt’ Inside FBI|Former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova suggested Friday James reopening of the investigation into Hillary emails was the product of a revolt inside the FBI. While speaking with Larry , diGenova was asked what Comey meant by saying newly discovered Clinton emails from Anthony Weiner and Huma devices appear to be pertinent to the prior investigation. It tells me that the original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation, diGenova said, otherwise they would have discovered this and tell you why. These were found on the phone that was used by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, he said. Why was that phone not looked at originally? There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright, and if she did, dead meat, and Comey knows it, and nothing he can do about it. diGenova continued: And why this letter was sent today was very simple: the agents came to Comey yesterday, they told him about the evidence, and he said oh and realized that his goose was cooked, that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent, and he knew that the agents running the Weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress. And also been told something very significant, been reported that those laptops [belonging to Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson] were destroyed, they were not, and the reason is the FBI agents refused to do it. diGenova went on to say he believes there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now. He sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau, he said. Comey sent this letter today because he had to. He has no moral authority inside the agency right now, a joke, a laughingstock of the agency, and among former FBI agents, he has become an anathema.

He claimed she had been forced by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. UK Express (h/t Terry D) The handout read: Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you. It had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the Bavarian school. Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their nursery was refusing to acknowledge Christmas rituals to accommodate the diverse cultures of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils. A spokesman for Kassel explained: There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.

7286|Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President|Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President Shadowproof with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein endorsement she had been working toward for years. As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for political reasons because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. Yes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because scared of regulations, scared of the other shoe dropping, just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth, Clinton said. So people are, you know, a little still uncertain, and uncertain both because they know what might come next in terms of regulations, but also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that only beginning to take hold of. Music to Wall ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. Despite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that you need both a public and a private position. So the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is private position on giving it to them?

There are probably many hidden chambers that are still left untouched which could give us a lead to the true purpose of this colossal pyramid. But one mystery surrounding the mega structure is the fact that the capstone is missing. How come? Was there a capstone in the first place? Some researchers say that the capstone may have been completely built in gold, so, if it was in fact made of such a solid material then how did they achieve on removing such a large massive piece with aproximately 9 meters in height? Another theory suggests that the pyramid had a large sphere in it's summit, which served as a conductor of cosmic energy and would turn the pyramid into a massive power plant. The sphere could also be associated with the ""Eye of Horus"" and the brightest star in the sky ""Sirius"" . Watch the following video to learn more!

7297|Hillary Clinton Appears Disoriented And Confused At New York Airport Day Before Presidential Election|Hillary Clinton Appears Disoriented And Confused At New York Airport Day Before Presidential Election A few seconds later, her handlers become aware that she's having a Parkinson's freeze moment, and immediately swarm around her pushing the video cameras backwards. But not before video of her is recorded showing she doesn't know what she's supposed to do. After Hillary Clinton posed for photos with the media covering her, she was confused about whether she needed to board the awaiting plane or get in the motorcade that had just dropped her off. Hillary Clinton was at the White Plains, New York airport about to start her day, when she exhibited some startling behavior . It was the very beginning of her day, so presumably she was rested and alert as she prepared to hit the campaign trail. Yet when speaking with the loud mob of reporters, she appeared to speak gibberish mixed in with her sentences, and laughing awkwardly even though nothing funny was being said. Then it got really weird. Shocking Video Footage Of A Confused Hillary Clinton Mumbling Gibberish On Campaign Trail As she walks in the direction of her personal campaign plane, she suddenly freezes and is not sure whether she needs to get into the motorcade which had just dropped her off, or board the plane like she was supposed to do. A few seconds later , her handlers become aware that having another freeze moment , and immediately swarm around her pushing the video cameras backwards. But not before video of her is recorded showing she know what supposed to do. Health: More than just a cough The cameras capture her saying where am I going? and then what am I doing? before she disappears into the protective huddle of her watchers. This stands is very stark contrast to am energized Donald Trump, making nearly a dozen stops in a 24 hour period and speaking for almost an hour wherever he goes. Hillary Clinton barely has the energy to get out of her car, and when she does get out, she has no idea what to do after that. This deceitful woman is not only hiding her crimes and scandals , she and her people are also hiding the fact that she is very ill and physically unfit to serve for 4 years as president of the United States.

73|House Dems ‘shame’ opponents of defeated LGBT rights bill|Shouts of shame, shame, shame erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors. The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough yes votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber. But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212. All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 were from Republicans. Eight House members three Republicans and five Democrats did not vote. LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people. Democrats chanted shame, shame, shame at Republicans, drawing attention to the vote. Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, denounced it in a fiery speech. We had 217 people for non-discrimination right up until the last moment, he said. emotional vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included religious freedom language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language. Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.|2022-09-26 05:00:00|REAL|Noah Khan|City Times|130426|95415|358|2866|Ukraine|English|2022-09-14 17:00:00|Noticia destacada|1|True|2152800|1159200|1928|5.966666666666667

Former Miss Finland accuses Trump of sexual assault, bringing number of accusers to 12 By 0 58 Miss Finland 2006 has become the 12th woman to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen claims the presidential candidate groped her while they took a picture together before an appearance on Late Show with David 10 years ago. Laaksonen, now 30, told Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat on Thursday that Trump groped her in New York in July 2006. A translation provided by the Daily Beast explains that the incident occurred when she and three other Miss Universe contestants were taking photos outside the Late Show studio. Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt, she said. I think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, is The beauty queen also attended parties at residence with Melania, whom he had married one year prior to the incident. Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger , she told The Telegraph. Trump has vowed to sue all of his accusers, calling them horrible, horrible liars .

7307|Worst Of Saudi Economic Slump Yet To Come|Worst Of Saudi Economic Slump Yet To Come 11/07/2016 PRESS TV Experts say the outlook for Saudi economic recovery will remain murky for many months to come with some even warning that the worst of the economic slump for the kingdom is yet to come. Reuters in a report quoted several Riyadh-based experts as saying that there would be a high degree of uncertainty over the status of the Saudi economy in 2017. That would mainly be a result of the remaining challenges from the private sector. The Saudi economy may appear to have escaped a fiscal and currency crisis that loomed at the start of 2016. However, experts said, threats from certain basic problems still remain and will haunt the kingdom next year. The government owes its success to temporarily escape crisis to unpaid bills rather than sustainable spending cuts. The government has reduced or suspended payments that it owed to construction firms, medical establishments and even some of the foreign consultants who helped to design the economic reforms, Reuters added quoting the experts. The estimated unpaid dues for construction firms alone totaled 80 billion riyals. Experts further warned that this could store up obligations for Riyadh in the future. Reuters elsewhere emphasized that signs of the economic slump could be seen in Riyadh and other major cities, where discounts of 50 percent or more are offered by stores selling clothes and consumer electronics, and there is a surge in people offering second-hand cars for sale. The biggest uncertainty may be how authorities can push through a key part of their reform drive, added the report. The most important issue for the Saudis may be determining how they plan to foster a vibrant private sector that does not depend on oil revenues while at the same pushing ahead austerity policies that are suppressing private demand. Experts also warned that the status of the Saudi job market over the next few years. Between 1 million and 2 million of Saudi 10 million foreign workers may leave over the next couple of years as the economic slowdown causes lay-offs and the government seeks to steer Saudi citizens into jobs previously held by foreigners, Reuters added.|2022-09-27 23:00:00|FAKE|Chloe Nguyen|The Daily Dispatch|576711|76280|323|4696|Tanzania|English|2022-09-10 13:00:00|Reportaje|1|True|2304000|799200|2187|5.383333333333334
7312|Peter Thiel On Trump|Recipient Email => I earnestly recommend that everyone watch Peter 13-minute address at the National Press Club this morning. He hits a number of nails on the head. A few at random: [ At 1m08s ] The truth is, no matter how crazy this election seems it is less crazy than the condition of our country. Thiel checks off some of the craziness: the national debt, healthcare costs, student loans, income stagnation, And wars : [ At 2m52s ] While households struggle to keep up with the challenges of everyday life, the government is wasting trillions of dollars of taxpayer money on faraway wars. Right now fighting five of them: in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Somalia. Which is the more enthusiastically pro-war party? The Democrats! [ At 7m55s ] Yet even after these bipartisan failures, the Democratic Party today is more hawkish than at any time since it began the war in Vietnam. the root problem? Optimism ! [ At 8m55s ] For a long time our elites have been in the habit of denying difficult realities. Why is Trump the solution? [ At 10m54s ] Nobody would suggest that Donald Trump is a humble man; but the big things right about amount to a much-needed dose of humility in our politics. Very unusually for a presidential candidate, he has questioned the core concept of American exceptionalism. He think that the force of optimism alone can change realities without hard work. Just as much as about making America great, agenda is about making America a normal country. The only nail whose head Thiel leaves un -hit is immigration. This is a bit odd, as there is probably no other single issue that accounts for so much of popular support. somewhat less odd to those of us who recall Thiel taking up an interest in the immigration issue some years ago, then quickly dropping it as, apparently, too radioactive. We at VDARE.com are bolder; which is one reason although, so be sure, a very minor one why we have much, much less money than he does. It is none the less heartening to see a successful entrepreneur speaking so clearly and eloquently in support of Trump. Watch the whole thing on YouTube .

7340|Hillary Literally Became the Definition of ‘Pathological Lying’ on Google Yesterday|( ANTIMEDIA ) If you had happened to Google the term on Sunday evening, you would have been met with none other than the bright, smiling face of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Before Wikipedia administrators put a temporary lock on the entry early Monday morning, the top Google result for the term was a link to the Wiki article displaying photo, along with the following quote defining pathological lying: It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders. The revision history of the entry shows the picture of Clinton was originally added to the Wikipedia article on the morning of October 29th, but it until the next night that the ever-vigilant internet community took notice and excitedly spread the word on Facebook and Twitter . Check out the Google Trends report for below: Unsurprisingly, most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article, once again showing the general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Hillary Clinton. The most popular response was liar, followed by dishonest and untrustworthy. Maybe if the biggest names in journalism outright colluding with campaign , that poll would have been more widely reported. Maybe. Due to the fact major media corporations are completely ignoring the corruption surrounding the Clinton campaign, it has been left to Wikileaks, independent media outlets, and the social media community to push this information into the public eye. Just a week away from the election, new evidence was discovered that prompted the FBI to announce they have reopened the criminal investigation into private email server. With Republican nominee Donald Trump scheduled to appear in court to face rape allegations, there is a high possibility the next president of the United States will be facing criminal charges before even inaugurated. If nothing else, this election cycle is proving that people want truth and get creative to expose it.

735|New Poll Finds Donald Trump Almost Caught Up with Hillary Clinton|Republicans have rallied behind Donald Trump in recent weeks, as the businessman and reality-TV star cleared an all but assured path to the presidential nomination. Trump has narrowed Democratic candidate Hillary lead to 3 percentage points, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The margin of error for the poll is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. Clinton leads trump 46 percent to 43 percent, marking a significantly smaller margin between the two likely nominees and the first time Clinton has not led Trump by double digits since December. In April, Clinton led Trump by 11 percentage points, 50 percent to 39 percent, according to a NBC News/WSJ poll. Insofar as individual polls mean anything, the swell of support for Trump could suggest that Republican voters are accepting their presumptive nominee after his win in the Indiana primary earlier this month, and after Senator Ted Cruz, final primary opponent, dropped out. The poll comes out amid new bitterness in the Democratic primary battle. NBC points out just 66 percent of Democratic voters who prefer Sanders will support Clinton in a matchup against Trump, underscoring the challenge she faces in winning over necessary votes in the general election. According to the poll, Clinton and Trump have one thing in common: both are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees, with 54 percent of registered voters who have a negative opinion of Clinton and 58 percent having a negative opinion of Trump. If nominated at such rates, they would also be the most unpopular candidates since the poll began in 1984.|2022-09-09 23:00:00|REAL|Ava Murphy|The Pulse|630186|1246|512|5651|Turkey|English|2022-09-03 22:00:00|Noticia internacional|1|True|748800|226800|1606|8.533333333333333

Anderson Cooper is known to be the cool, mild-mannered news host of CNN's AC 360. But the shade he threw on Newt Gingrich after his rant against Megyn Kelly was nothing short of scorching. sick and tired of people like you using language inflammatory, not true! Gingrich exploded on The Kelly File. When you use the words, you took a position. And I think very unfair of you to do that! Then, the former Speaker went for the throat: You wanna go back through the tapes of your show recently? You are fascinated with sex and you care about public policy! what I get out of watching you tonight! Anderson Cooper noticed something unusual about Gingrich's line of attack: For Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex, Cooper stated. This is a guy, what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. that right? That's about right. Newt Gingrich admitted to cheating on his first and second wives and having an affair during the Clinton impeachment hearings. Watch the segment: Trump supporters may not be pleased with the way Megyn Kelly has commented on all of those accusations, and her throwing doubt upon Juanita Broaddrick's rape claims against Bill Clinton did not win her friends in that camp. But love her or hate her, it's not Megyn's job to be the Trump campaign's unofficial spokeswoman. It may be her job to assume the role of a news commentator, however, rather than that of an objective journalist. The idea that there is objectivity when it comes to reporting the news is a tired and dangerous cliche the American people should put to rest. As for being fascinated by sex, it just might be that Kelly is professionally interested in sexual assault and groping allegations against a presidential candidate, unfounded or otherwise, since the way those are perceived by the public just might sway a national election.|2022-10-06 14:00:00|FAKE|Logan Wong|Newsflash|976653|92153|74|3313|France|English|2022-09-22 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|1803600|3049200|2094|1.2333333333333334

7359|Voting Machine Shocker: Video Proof Election Is Rigged!|The Clinton campaign have found a way to rig voting machines in order to commit election fraud, and America is completely clueless. Via YourNewsWire Dominion Voting Systems, the biggest voting machine owner in the United States, has been Exposed donating to the Clinton Foundation, and has close ties to George Soros. In 2010 Dominion Voting Machines bought out the right to own the machines in 600 jurisdictions across 22 different states, according to Wikipedia. The same company, Dominion Voting, has also been exposed donating enough money to the Clinton Foundation to make it to their online donor list. Is it any wonder voters have already started reporting that some machines are flipping their votes? How blatant is that! Just take a look at the Clinton website itself. Wow. That is just such a strange coincidence, you think? Right around the same time Hillary Clinton was deciding to retire as Secretary of State and focus on her campaign, this company bought out half the voting machines in the country. And if that is not bad enough, one of the top owners of Dominion Voting is none other than the king of corruption himself, George Soros. But it gets even worse. Dominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project. In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections. This presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations. As we previously reported , the Democratic primaries were essentially rigged. So why the general U.S. election potentially be manipulated in favor of the preferred candidate? If you think this is as important of information as I do, then share this out immediately.

If the country does not accept the loan, the leader of this particular country will be assassinated and a Rothschild aligned leader will be put into the position , and if the assassination does not work, the country will be invaded and have a Central Bank established with force all under the name of terrorism. Rothschild-owned Central Bank Central banks are illegally created private banks that are owned by the Rothschild banking family . The family has been around for more than 230 years and has slithered its way into each country on this planet, threatened every world leader and their governments and cabinets with physical and economic death and destruction, and then emplaced their own people in these central banks to control and manage each pocketbook.

His successor, Abd al-Malik, the fifth caliph, built the better-known Dome of the Rock atop the Temple Mount in A.D. 691. A recently studied limestone dedicatory plaque in the Nuba mosque describes the village as an endowment for the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, but what is notable is it refers to the Dome of the Rock as the rock of the Bayt al-Maqdis Holy Temple the literal translation of the Hebrew term used by early Muslims for the city of Jerusalem and the Temple gold-dome shrine. The stone bearing the inscription sits above the niche that faces toward Mecca. It reads: In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, this territory, Nuba, and all its boundaries and its entire area, is an endowment to the Rock of Bayt al-Maqdis and the al-Aqsa Mosque, as it was dedicated by the Commander of the Faithful, Umar ibn al-Khattab for the glory of Allah.|2022-09-28 06:00:00|FAKE|Ava Murphy|Newsline|829332|16363|205|6055|Myanmar|English|2022-09-19 18:00:00|Crítica|1|True|1594800|2329200|1245|3.4166666666666665

But also looking at the one situation that can get people to start working together who might otherwise have simply continued to jockey for power. looking at you, establishment Democrats.) Mind you. still wretched. But look at it this way: now, we can deal with our racist, sexist, patriarchist history head on. Every Sanders supporter is, deep inside, saying I told you so. And right. Virtually every poll had Bernie thumping Trump soundly. All the arguments people make in favor of Trump, which they seemed to think outweighed his flaws, included bucking the system. All of those people would have voted for Bernie. Someone very close to me, who had been a Republican for four decades, registered Democrat to vote for Bernie in the primary; and they voted for Trump yesterday. Bernie was the people's candidate; independents (who now comprise 45% of the electorate) favored him 2:1. There's no doubt he would have trounced Trump; but there is also no doubt that Bernie's ideas are America's ideals. We just can't let these lunatics have their way with the country. So look. really no time to lose. get the ball rolling. The midterms are two years away; we need to win big. Trump has a Republican Congress; dear lord, the horror. There's a presidential election to win two years after that. Local elections up and down the line. And a lot of grassroots organizing, fundraising, and door-knocking to accomplish.

7388|FEAR OF TRUMP: BUSH, OBAMA, CLINTON ALL BUYING PROPERTY IN NON-EXTRADITION NATIONS|Email It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country.

7391|Trump Family Say Trump Brand Has NOT Been Damaged|Fans Thrilled as NFL Team Stands for Then Players Unleash Sick Surprise I think the brand is hotter than ever been, but it matter to me. I care, Trump stated in a taped interview that aired Thursday on Good Morning America. It matter. I care about the brand. I care about the country. His words were echoed by his son Eric, who also felt confident about the survivability of the brand in the face of relentless attacks. I think we have the hottest brand in the world right now, and I think buildings like this are a testament to what we do every day, Eric Trump said, referring to the hotel that had just opened ahead of schedule and under budget. There has been some damage attempted against the family business via negative press and spiteful boycotts, such as the mean-spirited campaign to ruin Ivanka clothing and accessories line by tying it to the leaked 2005 tape of Trump making vulgar comments about certain women. However, Donald Trump Jr. insisted that in spite of the negative press the brand was doing just fine and was even expanding, proving it was far more than just a real estate development group tied to the New York City and tri-state area. The brand is much more than New York City. This is a global brand, Trump Jr. said. I mean, when you look at the people touching on a daily basis, the presidency, fixing America is so much bigger than any of that regardless. Granted, it is entirely possible that the Trump brand will suffer long-term from the unceasing onslaught of negative coverage, though it is also just as likely that the brand could even grow in popularity, depending upon how the 2016 election ultimately plays out.|2022-09-25 22:00:00|FAKE|Sophie Chen|World News Network|705448|54124|602|4137|South Africa|English|2022-09-18 04:00:00|Reportaje especial|0|True|1458000|2127600|1649|10.033333333333333

Nothing, nada, zilch. But she does like rap music, loves hot sauce, and Mexican food is her So, yeah, VOTE FOR HER. Meanwhile, Trump is talking about the issues that matter to the American people. Jobs, security, the economy. Trump represents a new direction for America, where the needs of Americans are placed above foreign interests and are greedy donors and lobbyists. Hillary represents the same thing got now a stagnant economy, global politics, and dangerous progressive ideologies. Trump is the candidate of CHANGE. Our dishonest North Korea-style government-run propaganda media whose sole purpose is to spew pro-Hillary rhetoric, anti-Trump lies, and cover up for the most unliked candidate in the history of American elections, says the election is OVER. Hillary has won it. So, why is Hillary on black radio shows saying rappers have INFLUENCED HER (hahaha) and going on Hispanic radio, telling everyone that Mexican food is her favorite? Sounds pretty DESPERATE To me. INSULTING too. To think that minorities are so dumb that vote for someone because they like a certain type of music or food. This is typical Clinton old school politics. Treating minorities like dullards by pandering to them around voting time and then ignoring them the rest of the time.

He sell his values to common thugs who use bylines as weapons. According to both Williams and his attorney, Jonathan Franks, Jacob Bernstein from The Times approached Williams, asking for cooperation on a story alleging that people who live in Trump-branded buildings want the Trump name removed in light of the very difficult and contentious 2016 election season. Williams, an independent who lives in a Trump-developed New York building, declined to cooperate. According to Franks, Bernstein replied to a specific request not to print address by stating he would be more likely to extend that courtesy if Montel gave an interview. Protecting another privacy, especially the privacy of the ballot box, is not a special courtesy. simply common decency. The Washington Examiner took their colleagues at The Times to task for this low-life journalism, noting that Williams identifies as a conservative but is not a registered Republican.

7399|This Will END Hillary’s Campaign, HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING DOWN|October 30, 2016 at 1:18 PM Right now we are at a pivot point in this history as important as any time in the past. We have the choice over the next 9 days to elect a woman who has proven time and time again that she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, operate outside and above the law. Or we can elect a person who appears to represent values quite the opposite of Killer Clinton. This Moonpie last venture into the Oval Office was filled with scandals from the very minute they entered the White House through their exit, carrying every bit of furniture and silverware they could load in their U-Haul trailer. Their body count runs to the millions when you take into account the destruction of other countries during their despotic reign And Bush was even worse. Have we forgotten the nearly 80 men women and children (22)of the Branch Dividians, murdered by armed goons on the direct order of Janet Reno, Killer hired assassin and attorney General. Did we forget that Madeline Albright, Secretary of State, when she bragged about a 500,000 body count as an acceptable death toll in Central Europe, as husband sent in his mercenaries to slaughter innocent civilians in Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia while supporting puppet regimes and war lords who murdered millions of their peoples through planned genocide. How about Rwanda with the death toll that was well in excess of 500,000. I recall Bill Clinton basically saying Ooops. Sorry. I guess I kind of missed that about another blow job. I really get off getting head while I shoot some cruise missiles at the people in Iraq and Afghanistan It sure defines Getting off I guess the memory hole is just that deep. Idiots and morons will elect Killer because they either know nothing of history, care about the death toll or actually like the idea that this psychopathic murdering mutant bitch might actually be elected to the highest office in the land. Anyone who voted for Killer votes for death by the number and democide by the millions. When it comes to Trump, not a fan of his either. But when given the choice of Killer or Trump I am forced to chose between the lesser of two evils. BIG EVIL lives in the skin of Killer Clinton. Whatever lives in the skin of Trump is, I am convinced, is far less a danger to the Republic (in name only) than Killer Klinton and her Blood thirsty Killer Klown Klan|2022-10-03 22:00:00|FAKE|Ella Sharma|The Observer|664922|46226|369|7831|Mexico|English|2022-09-22 11:00:00|Artículo de investigación|0|True|2818800|1828800|2369|6.15
7401|If Clinton Campaign Believes WikiLeaks Emails Are Forged, Why Don’t They Prove It!?|Elections 2016 Top democrats have repeatedly waved off substantial questions arising from their hacked emails by falsely implying that some of them are forgeries created by Russian hackers. The problem with that is that no one has found a single case of anything forged among the information released from hacks of either Clinton campaign or Democratic Party officials. Clinton strategist Joel Benenson, asked about an email in which Clinton campaign staffers decide to accept foreign lobbyist money, used that line on MSNBC on Sunday. These emails, we have no idea whether authentic or not, he said. Or whether been tampered with. I know seen things that authentic, that we know authentic, and not surprising. Jennifer Granholm, a senior adviser to the pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record, was asked by Jake Tapper whether the Clinton campaign should be responding to revelations revealed by Wikileaks. There are reports that these have been doctored, she told Tapper on October 19. And Newsweek had found that, in fact, that was happening. In an interview with Wolf Blitzer on October 18, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, was asked if the Russian government would impact the election by hacking voting systems. What worries me the most is between now and the election the Russians dump information that is fabricated, Schiff warned. To get a last minute dump of emails that contain fabricated emails that are widely reported in the press, and there enough time to fact check and demonstrate the forgery, that is what really concerns me. CNN host Wolf Blitzer pushed back, But have you confirmed that any of these emails released over the past two weeks, if you will, by Wikileaks are fabricated or doctored? You know not in a position to be able to do that, Schiff demurred. Everything considered, the conclusion has to be that Wikileaks emails are probably authentic and if they they would have been disproven a long, long time ago. The question is if are you willing to vote for a person that (we saw in the emails) is capable of doing very, bad, dirty stuff. And if the answer is yes then this country has a BIG, BIG PROBLEM.

P&O bravely asks the public to name its new ferry By 0 50 The cruise company P&O has taken the plunge and decided to ask the public to name its new ferry. This comes in spite of the Boaty McBoatface debacle earlier this year. A 2016 attempt by the public to name a £200 million ($243 million) arctic research vessel Boaty McBoatface was foiled when the fun police decided it was just too daft. In a tweet posted on Wednesday, P&O threw caution to the wind, saying it is proud to announce that the name of our new will be decided by you our guests! Read more Within minutes, Boaty McBoatface was reprised as a suggestion, alongside Cruisy McCruiseface and Shippy McShipface. Other suggestions ranged from Hard Brexit to Bryan Ferry, after the 1980s pop star. Sensing a deliberate cry for attention, another tweeter branded the ship HMS Social Media Gimmick. The original was eventually named RRS Richard Attenborough after the famed BBC explorer and zoologist. Earlier this year, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) asked the public to choose a name via the internet competition Name Our Ship, but after the exceedingly popular moniker Boaty McBoatface won the poll with more than 124,000 votes, the builders overruled the decision. In the face of public outcry, a small yellow submersible that will operate from the Richard Attenborough was christened Boaty McBoatface. The BBC naturalist attended the traditional keel-laying ceremony in Merseyside in October. The vessel will cost an estimated £200 million, and is the largest commercial shipbuilding project in Britain in over 30 years. It is expected to set sail to Antarctica in 2019, sending the most advanced research on the oceans and climate change back to Britain. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today program, Sir David confirmed that the infamous moniker will be put to use for an autonomous submarine serving the ship.|2022-10-02 14:00:00|FAKE|Sophie Chen|The Insight|540223|55975|299|7538|Iran|English|2022-09-20 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2703600|1692000|1978|4.983333333333333

Well, prepare to engage in battle yet again folks with this viral picture totes dividing the internets. Uploaded to numerous social media channels yesterday morning, this picture of a Syrian man has gone viral after users struggled to figure out whether or not he was covered in white rubble from an airstrike or if he was just all shiny and covered in some kind of silly oil. Once you see it, you just see anything else, posted one absolute genius, who pretty much summed up the whole picture with one epic tweet containing just 40 characters. Whilst many internet players were quick to point out that the Aleppo man was shiny or covered in plastic, others corrected them by pointing out that the man was actually covered in concrete dust from an Assad led airstrike which launched an illegal barrel bomb that killed at least 15 people, many of whom were women and children. crazy how your eyes deceive you like that, pointed out another user of the internet web, say the guy know what hit him after his picture went viral. In fact, on closer inspection, it becomes obvious that the man is covered head to toe in chalk like material, probably from exploding concrete and falling rubble, as well as what appears to be ketchup on his forearm.

7413|Finland Will Become the First Country in the World to Get Rid of All School Subjects|LIFESTYLE education system is considered one of the best in the world. In international ratings, always in the top ten. However, the authorities there ready to rest on their laurels, and decided to carry through a real revolution in their school system. Finnish officials want to remove school subjects from the curriculum. There will no longer be any classes in physics, math, literature, history, or geography. The head of the Department of Education in Helsinki, Marjo Kyllonen, explained the changes: There are schools that are teaching in the old-fashioned way which was of benefit in the beginning of the 1900s but the needs are not the same, and we need something fit for the 21st century. Instead of individual subjects, students will study events and phenomena in an interdisciplinary format. For example, the Second World War will be examined from the perspective of history, geography, and math. And by taking the course Working in a Cafe, students will absorb a whole body of knowledge about the English language, economics, and communication skills. This system will be introduced for senior students, beginning at the age of 16. The general idea is that the students ought to choose for themselves which topic or phenomenon they want to study, bearing in mind their ambitions for the future and their capabilities. In this way, no student will have to pass through an entire course on physics or chemistry while all the time thinking to themselves What do I need to know this for? The traditional format of teacher-pupil communication is also going to change. Students will no longer sit behind school desks and wait anxiously to be called upon to answer a question. Instead, they will work together in small groups to discuss problems. The Finnish education system encourages collective work, which is why the changes will also affect teachers. The school reform will require a great deal of cooperation between teachers of different subjects. Around 70% of teachers in Helsinki have already undertaken preparatory work in line with the new system for presenting information, and, as a result, get a pay increase. The changes are expected to be complete by 2020. What do you think about all these ideas? love to hear your opinion, so let us know in the comments.

Oh, one I like. keep that one. I have real problems, so get your ballots in. Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary emails. Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote.

The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in?

The youngsters who jumped those college students as they walked to campus Friday night are delinquents who need to be put in check before too late. They were nothing but miscreants who took out their aggression and misdirected rage on random passersby. Why? Because they felt like wilding out that night. They were out to create chaos, so they did. So, talk to me about gentrification in North Philly. talk to me about poverty. talk to me about race relations. Those are whole other conversations and not what these attacks were about. No one was safe from these teens that night. Not the six Temple students who were injured. Not the Temple police officer knocked from her bicycle by a 15-year-old. Not even a police horse. Anyone could have gotten caught up in that madness. According to news reports, a crowd of 150 youngsters started gathering after an Instagram advertised an 8 p.m. meet-up at the AMC North Broad Street 7 (formerly the Pearl Theater at Avenue North), on Broad Street near Oxford at the southern end of the campus. {snip} Most of the high schoolers who responded to the online posting were good kids looking to socialize. But then the delinquents did what they often do and ruined it for everybody. According to police, a group of 20 to 30 boys and girls in their early to late teens randomly attacked Temple students as they returned from a football game at Lincoln Financial Field. {snip} People keep trying to make this a racial thing because at least two of the victims were white and all of the assailants were African American. They make that assumption even though we know the race of the other injured students. (Lots of African Americans go to Temple.) Nor do we know the race of the injured officers.

Barracuda Brigade 2016-10-28 Print The administration is blocking congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course she needs to plead the 5th. She either recall, refuses to answer, or just plain deflects the question. Straight up corruption at its finest! 100percentfedUp.com ; Talk about covering your ass! Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to to the core! Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney office is unacceptable and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the foremost state sponsor of terrorism, Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch.

7442|Destruction of Walk Of Fame star leaves Donald Trump down to his last six Horcruxes|Thursday 27 October 2016 by Davywavy Destruction of Walk Of Fame star leaves Donald Trump down to his last six Horcruxes Stabbing a copy of The Art Of The Deal with a tooth is the next step to eliminating Donald Trump, according to experts this morning. Donald Trump howled in agony and demanded a flask of milk to help him recover some strength after the destruction of his first Horcrux on Walk of Fame yesterday. Trump, whose unusually-styled hair is believed to hide a face on the back of his head, is understood to have concealed fragments of his soul in multiple receptacles in an attempt to protect himself from defeat in the forthcoming election. Fragments are believed to be hidden in places as diverse as the fabric of Trump Tower, a pussy he grabbed without warning in 2003, and Mike unnaturally shining white head of hair. The last Horcrux is believed to be the one national poll which has shown him in the lead. If destroyed, this would cause his organisation to fail and his acolytes, known as the Debt Eaters for their habit of bankruptcy, to disband. The Orange Lord is not concerned by this petty attack, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign. Only a cowardly child would act like this, and Donald challenges his attacker to meet him in debate where he shall win, and win, and win again. To show he meant business, Trump took off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves to threaten anyone who would wish him harm. However when Trump handed his jacket to his spokesman to hold, the spokesman cried and vanished. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton opinion research division, sent an email to senior staffers Thursday, outlining early signals as to why the candidate lost the November 8 presidential election, POLITICO reported on Friday. We believe that we lost this election in the last week, said email, which was published by POLITICO. letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters particularly in the suburbs. We also think 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster turnout, he continued. The letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate. Hillary Clinton makes a concession speech after being defeated by Donald Trump in New York on November 9, 2016. (Photo by AFP) Despite those challenges, Nayak said, Clinton was on course to win until the last week, when everything changed"" and the momentum began to shift in favor of Trump. Voters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin (42-47). These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states, he said. The FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. Just over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. Nayak said letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. There is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race, he wrote. In the end, Nayak concluded, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome.

(VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey For decades, gun-toting, ammosexual Right Wing Nut Jobs have claimed that the government is going to take their guns away. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has been preaching this kind of crap news for years, and blaming it on Democratic presidents. It turns out that the organization has finally admitted that this is a lie. When asked about it, President Barack Obama said : about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true. The NRA responded with : Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a and to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent. Even if Congress and the president were able to pass such a law, the Supreme Court would rule it unconstitutional if challenged since they would be going against the Second Amendment. Not only has the NRA lied about taking away guns, but Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is spreading that BS as well.

7480|President Obama’s Interview With Samantha Bee Will Have You Rolling On The Floor Laughing (VIDEO)|President Obama is known for his humor, but his interview with Samantha Bee is downright hilarious. During his final days in office, Obama has been making rounds on talk shows. When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. Bee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. She finally asked Obama if he would mess with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. After you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald ear, were right, I born just to, like, mess with him? Bee asked. I think fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where not close enough to him to whisper into his ear, Obama shot back. They did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States. But the playful back and forth between President Obama and Bee is too funny to miss. It also reminds us just why it is that we are going to miss this man so much when he is gone.

749|GOP Leaders: Donald Trump, Paul Ryan Meeting 'Critical'|"A top GOP leader is calling the meeting between Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan critical. The billionaire is heading to Capitol Hill Thursday to try and unify the party after a bruising primary election. House Republicans are urging the Speaker get behind their party's presumptive nominee. But Ryan, who has been reluctant to support Trump, says he wants to make sure it's done right. ""Look, I said this the other day: To pretend we are unified as a party after coming through a very bruising primary, which just ended like a week ago, to pretend to unify without actually unifying, then we go into the fall with half strength,"" the Wisconsin lawmaker warned. The meeting comes in the backdrop of ongoing questions over Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. ""You don't learn much from tax returns, but I would love to give the tax returns,"" the real estate mogul said. Now Trump says he won't release them until after an IRS audit is done, which may not be until after the election. Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has pounced on that. ""My husband and I have released 33 years of tax returns. So you gotta ask yourself why doesn't he want to release them?"" she said. On the subject of taxes, Politico reports Trump has brought in well-known conservative economists Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore to help him rewrite his initial tax plan. It's a plan one group said could tack on an additional $10 trillion to $12 trillion onto America's already exploding national debt, and help the economy grow more. ""The thing I'm going to do is to make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks because they have been absolutely shunned,"" Trump said. ""The other thing is that I'm going to fight very hard for business."" Trump is also considering tapping former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to a head a commission on radical Islam. The billionaire told Fox News he may set up the commission to study his immigration policies, including calls for a temporary ban on Muslims coming to America. But more than a week after officially becoming his party's presumptive nominee, many in the GOP are still split over Trump's conservative credentials. Meanwhile, although many have questioned whether he can actually beat Clinton in November, a new Reuters poll has him in a dead heat with the former state secretary, with Clinton at 41 percent, Trump at 40 percent and 19 percent undecided."|2022-09-25 10:00:00|REAL|Lily Wang|Newsflash|209385|13808|175|0|Uganda|English|2022-09-06 11:00:00|Análisis|1|True|446400|2084400|2393|2.9166666666666665

7498|Will the anti-Clinton revolt among American elites gain momentum?|Will the anti-Clinton revolt among American elites gain momentum? November 7, 2016 - Fort Russ Mikhail Khazin , one of the top Russian economists- Translated from Russian by Kristina Kharlova There are rumors of revolt in the US state apparatus in the broad sense of the word against Hillary Clinton. Note that the top layer of the US establishment still supports Clinton, squashing any signs of disobedience: FBI closes cases, newspapers stop printing nasty things about her and so on. But one way or the other the issue floats to the surface. One of the likely reasons for this, is that Hillary Clinton is actively trading the national sovereignty of the United States in the framework of the activities of her foundation. In other words, American patriots consider her a traitor. And, as it turned out, this factor may play a decisive role. Previously it was not so obvious. In particular, the latest issue the sale by Lockheed Martin to Turkey of a few dozen fighters of the fifth generation. Clinton is an old lobbyist for this company, so there is no doubt that it's her achievement. The problem is that Turkey under the current circumstances may cease to be a US ally, and no one can guarantee that these fighters do not fall into the hands of potential adversaries. For this reason, I do not exclude that these actions led to the resumption of the case against Clinton by the FBI. The results of tomorrow's elections remain unclear. But one thing is for sure: there are many people in the US who do not advertise their fondness of Trump, but in reality are ready to support him in the election. That is why the result of the vote may be surprising.

7514|News: Democracy Win: Volunteers Across The Country Are Oiling Up The Sidewalks To Help Voters Slide Uncontrollably To Their Polling Place|Email Despite the fact that voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, only 60 percent of eligible voters turn out in a presidential election. But this year we may see that number spike, because groups of incredible volunteers are doing everything they can to get out the vote: hitting the road and oiling up the sidewalks to help voters slide uncontrollably to their polling places. Democracy FTW! You might not know their names, but these hardworking men and women are out there in the trenches from Maine to California, slathering thick, black oil on the ground so every American can skid down the road, windmilling their arms wildly to try and stay upright, and careen straight through the doors of a voting booth. Republican or Democrat, these patriotic volunteers want every American to have access to a frictionless slick of oil that leads right to a polling place. Yes! These incredible volunteers are absolutely killing it! Rather than letting our election be decided by a select few, people from across the nation are volunteering their time to make sidewalks well-lubricated and slippery for as many voters as possible. As of this morning, footpaths have been oiled in all 50 states, giving people who would not otherwise have the time or desire to vote the opportunity to lose their balance and slide forward at alarming speeds with their arms flailing and legs kicking, until they crash face-first into a registered polling location. We might live in a democracy, but we have a truly representative election without the help of a select few everyday heroes. So when the polling stations close and every last slippery, oil-covered voter has put their ballot in the box and slid back out the door, remember those brave volunteers, because we do it without them.|2022-10-10 06:00:00|FAKE|Michael Sharma|The Insight|443972|79934|90|884|Myanmar|English|2022-09-28 08:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|2336400|3366000|1773|1.5

Last Wednesday the Canadian dollar rallied after the Bank of Canada referenced downside risks to inflation and then barely an hour later the Loonie plummeted when Governor Poloz said the committee actively considered cutting rates. Then on Monday we saw a similar dynamic play out when Poloz said the best plan right now, we think, is to wait for the next 18 months or so, in a testimony to the House of Commons. The Loonie strengthened significantly on the comment only to completely reverse when Poloz said the comment referred to the output gap and note monetary policy.

7521|Scientists say weird signals from space are 'probably' aliens|Scientists say weird signals from space are aliens A team of astronomers believes that strange signals emanating from a cluster of stars are actually aliens trying to tell the universe they exist. The study, which appeared in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, analyzed the odd beams of light from 234 stars a fraction of the 2.5 million that were observed. The bizarre beacons led the authors, Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, to conclude that probably aliens. We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis, wrote Borra and Trottier. They also note that their findings align with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars. The hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than, say, radio waves to reveal its existence. Click link for article... **MODS - If this is a duplicate please delete / and or lock ** So apparently signals detected from 230+ stars are fitting the hypothesized parameters established for extraterrestrial intelligence. The stars in question also fit the hypothesized parameters for supporting life. Since only a small amount of stars in the area being looked at are fitting the parameters they are using that as further evidence in support of their claims.

One that fits the latter category centers on an exchange between Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta and Neera Tanden, of the hard-left Center for American Progress , concerning an apparent leak that needed shall we say? plugging? The original email was from Tanden to Podesta, dated March 8, 2015 and time-stamped 4:49 p.m. the message: Ron Fournier is a writer for National Journal. The highlighted link in the email takes you to an article at National Journal with the intriguing title Emails May Be a Key to Addressing Whispers at Clinton Foundation.

Here is response, sent a half-hour later: Eric Braverman, the name Podesta throws out as the likely mole, is a former CEO of the Clinton Foundation. Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone has posted a tweet in reaction partly to this exchange in which he advances the claim that Braverman was working with WikiLeaks and now fears assassination by the Clinton machine: Word on the street is Eric Braverman, Clinton Foundation CEO, has fled the USA and is attempting to gain asylum in Russia.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the decision to open up an investigation into Secretary emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election, said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton. It's silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismiss.Except that bizarre and unlikely tactics, no longer are. There was outrage over MoveOn's attack on Petraeus and even most Dems thought that it was unhelpful. This attack on Comey I suspect will meet with little criticism. Some Dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record, Comey is as likely to hurt Hillary as he is himself.|2022-10-04 13:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Herald Tribune|530054|30411|276|2767|China|English|2022-09-23 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2872800|1951200|1655|4.6

7529|Daesh abducts 1000s near Mosul to use them as human shields: UN|Iraq Civilians leave their homes as Iraqi troops fight against Daesh militants in the village of Tob Zawa. (Photo by AP) Daesh terrorists have abducted tens of thousands of civilians from near Mosul to use them as human shields as government forces inch closer to the city proper in an operation to retake it, the UN says. UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the terrorist group also killed at least 232 people on Wednesday, including 190 former Iraqi security forces and 40 civilians, who refused to obey its orders. Many of them who refused to comply were shot on the spot, Shamdasani said in Geneva, citing reports corroborated by the UN that were by no means comprehensive but indicative of violations. As the news emerged, Hashd al-Shaabi volunteers said they were set to launch an offensive against Daesh west of Mosul imminently. Ahmad al-Assadi, a spokesman for the popular forces, confirmed that the fighters had completed preparations to move in the direction of Tal Afar, a Daesh-held city 63 kilometers west of Mosul. He added that the fighters would move to capture Tal Afar from their positions in the Iraqi town of Qayyara, situated some 60 kilometers south of Mosul. A few days or hours separate us from the launch of operations there, Asadi said. Iraqi forces liberated three key areas from Daesh terrorists east of Mosul. Army officials said troops also seized a tank and artillery from the terrorists, and found a two-kilometer-long tunnel full of ammunition. The army is edging closer to Mosul by liberating villages around the city. Nearly 80 Daesh-held towns and villages have been retaken by the army since the Iraqi forces began the battle to liberate Mosul last week.

The Bonyan [forces] have been advancing in Ghiza Bahriya and thank God there have been no causalities so far, there are only some wounded,"" said Hussien Edra, a member of the Bonyan Marsous Brigade. In May, the internationally-backed pro-government troops started a large-scale military operation, including street-by-street fighting backed by heavy airstrikes and artillery fire, to eradicate Daesh militants in Sirte. They have so far recaptured most areas in the city. Most of Daesh commanders in the city fled to other places and the remaining rank has been holding out via sniper fire, booby traps and car bombs. Sirte is the only key base of the Takfiri militant group outside Iraq and Syria.

The North African country has witnessed unrest since 2011, when a NATO military intervention followed the uprising that led to the ouster and killing of long-time dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Liberating the key city would deal a major blow to the militant group in its drive to expand its influence to territories beyond the Middle East.

A landslide on the main highway linking Colombia's two biggest cities has killed at least six people and trapped an unknown number under tons of earth. Antioquia state rescue chief Mario Parodi says four people were rescued and hospitalized after the Wednesday morning disaster covered all four lanes of the highway linking Bogota with Medellin. Rescuers with dogs joined the search for victims. Parodi said two motorcycles, a truck and two small vehicles were buried by the slide, which covered two football fields. He said the highway would be closed for several days. Landslides are not uncommon in Colombia's rugged mountainous terrain.

The Vermont senator's still way behind, but says he's not giving up, calling his win in West Virginia ""tremendous."" Clinton still holds a commanding delegate lead, but Sanders still has the fight in him. ""We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination!"" he declared. But Sanders' quest appears to be almost impossible, with Clinton 94 percent of the way to winning the nomination. ""I am, if I am so fortunate enough as to be the nominee - I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump come the fall,"" she said. Still, Clinton faces the FBI investigation of her email scandal. In addition, her loss in West Virginia, a state she took in 2008, was payback for her statements in March that a lot of coal miners and coal companies would be out of business. She's also polling badly among whites, men, and young people, with many loyal Sanders supporters vowing to never vote for her. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump kept rolling, winning West Virginia and Nebraska. The billionaire told the Associated Press he's looking at five or six people as his running mate, all with deep political experience. One person that Trump will likely not be considering is Sen. Marco Rubio, who told CNN he disagrees with Trump's ""America first"" foreign policy. ""I have well defined differences with the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party,"" Rubio said. ""And like millions of Republicans, you try to reconcile those two things."" Trump will be meeting on Capitol Hill Thursday with Republican leaders, a group he has railed against, to try to patch up the public differences they've had. Unifying the Democrats is going to be an issue for Clinton too, as many Sanders voters have said they wouldn't vote for her.

A minister who was hired by the Georgia Department of Public Health was recently fired because of his faith, and sermon contents. Dr. Eric Walsh, a Seventh-day Adventist lay minister, is suing the State of Georgia Department of Public Health for religious discrimination. A very simple question should cross your mind as you read this report, should my sermons be approved by the Government or God? The state of Georgia inquired that the pastor relinquish his sermons to the government, according to federal court documents. Please produce a copy of your sermon notes and/or transcripts, Attorney General Samuel Olens wrote to attorneys representing Dr. Eric Walsh. Dr. Walsh refuses to comply with the request because in May 2014, when Walsh was hired by the District Health Director; another government official asked him to submit copies of his sermons for review. He complied, and two days later he was fired. His attorneys said the government was curious about sermons Dr. Walsh delivered on health, marriage, sexuality, world religions, science, and creationism. He also preached on what the Bible says regarding homosexuality. Since the event, Dr. Walsh has filed a federal lawsuit charging state officials with engaging in religious discrimination. He was fired for something he said in a sermon, attorney Jeremy Dys told me. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything. Dr. Walsh has assembled a powerhouse legal team comprised of Parks, Chesin & Walbert along with First Liberty Institute, one of the most prominent religious liberty law firms.

Raised in that remarkable state of incurious joy and suffering within narrow undiluted lines of stratified suburban sameness, I could not know or question the things kept from sight. Thus racial determinism was assumed passively, an acquired naivete fueled with the aspirational angst of middle class parenting that served as an omniscient narcotic fog, like carbon monoxide not enough to be lethal, but just enough to render the critical faculties permanently dull until finally the things kept from sight could no longer be seen even upon close observation. To be white is to watch but not see while being seen but never watched. It is to know that for whatever law enforcement is or is not, they are something that will never have anything to do with me.

A candidate would normally address the crowd if there was a question as to the validity of results.

Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness, he said in a statement. The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law. Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September. In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least four new hearings after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public.

Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter, Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton , to laughs.

On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Trump no longer controls his Twitter account. Instead, the Republican nominee appears to have aides creating Trump safe messages on his behalf while he focuses his energy on whining and lying at his live rallies.

76|America's racial generation gap takes an ugly political turn|"America's ongoing diversity explosion should be greeted with optimism because of the opportunities it presents for revitalizing our country, energizing our labor force and providing greater connectivity to the global economy. But there is a hidden danger lurking in the form of an emerging generation gap with strong racial overtones that, left unchecked, could become a significant obstacle to progress. This gap has been greatly inflamed by the rhetoric of the presidential primaries. Its potential harm was illustrated in the canceled Donald Trump event earlier this month in Chicago, which saw young people of mixed races protesting against the views of what one of them called ""white suburbanites"" who embrace, often angrily, a vision of America that would shut them out. With more than a subtle focus on race, each party's candidates have also been talking to different generations. Hillary Clinton emphasizes concern for children in Flint, Michigan, ending child poverty and deportation and reforming the criminal justice system. Bernie Sanders reaches out to young people concerned about student debt and jobs. In contrast, Trump continues to talk tough on immigration and keeping out Muslims, on maintaining traditional American values, backing strong policing and protecting the middle class from tax increases. These stances mirror generationally different attitudes revealed in a 2012 Pew Survey that showed that more than half of white baby boomers and seniors view the rise of newcomers from other countries as a threat to traditional American values and customs, a view that was held by a minority of the millennial generation born in the early 1980s to the early 2000s. Generations are also divided on the role of government, with older people eschewing more services and higher taxes, and younger ones embracing the programs those services support."|2022-09-16 09:00:00|REAL|Daniel Patel|Voice of the Nation|419143|94880|162|3985|South Korea|English|2022-09-13 11:00:00|Crítica|0|True|1303200|1051200|1865|2.7

7606|Americans' Support for 'Assault Weapons' Ban at Record Low|Getty - Thomas Cooper Support for a ban on assault weapons is at the lowest rate in two decades, according to a poll released Wednesday. In an October survey from Gallup, 36 percent of Americans favor an assault weapons ban, down 21 percent since the pollster asked the same question in 1996. Image Credit: Gallup And the decrease in support for broader gun control measures spans all political affiliations. While 50 percent of Democrats support a ban, Independents and Republicans are more closely aligned with 31 percent and 25 percent support for an assault weapons ban, respectively. The only part of Gallup's survey that had Americans favoring stricter gun laws north of 50 percent centered on firearm sales specifically. According to Gallup, 55 percent of Americans think gun transactions should be more strict. However, that figure is also lower than levels from the 1990s. While assault rifles with selective fire are limited to military use absent a very rare and special permit, proposed assault weapons bans generally encompass semiautomatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns that some lawmakers deem too dangerous for public use. Gun rights and gun violence issues have been at the forefront of the presidential election for much of the year.

The change, due to take place on December 1, would let judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, potentially including foreign countries. Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties. We are concerned about the full scope of the new authority that would be provided to the Department of Justice, 23 senators and representatives wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The Supreme Court in April approved amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure that would allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnet. Those amendments will take effect on December 1 of this year unless Congress passes legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes. Some lawmakers, led by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, have introduced legislation that would halt the changes, but it has yet to gain much traction.

The dump trucks flank the skyscraper on all sides, and are supplemented by guardrails and heavily armed police officers. This morning, the building was not open to the general public and traffic crawled through a narrow corridor of trucks and police. On the street, supporters and protesters stood for interviews with a burgeoning press corps camped across the street. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lives in a penthouse near the top of the building, which also serves as headquarters for his presidential campaign. (RELATED: Election Day Voting Has Begun Who Is Winning?) Police told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the dumping beds are filled with sand, which adds weight to each truck, in effect making it impossible to run the barrier. Police decided to circle the Tower with trucks as a hedge against car bombs, or some such similar incendiary munition delivered by car. The fleet of trucks will travel with Trump this evening to surround the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan Hotel, where Trump is hosting his victory rally. The NYPD maintained a presence around the hotel for several days, which is also closed to the public. Guests staying in the hotel on unrelated business must present their keycards at a security check-point before entering the premises.

Comcast, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner dominate US broadcast and cable television news, entertainment and sports, movie and TV production, theme parks, record labels, publishing, and for-profit online operations. On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported telecommunications giant AT&T and Time Warner agreeing to merge. Approval, if granted, would likely assure greater consolidation in both industries benefitting corporate predators at the expense of the vast majority of consumers, giving them less choice than already, ensuring higher prices for poorer service. Hillary is a Wall Street, war profiteers, corporate predators tool, virtually certain to support this outrageous deal likely to get FCC and Justice Department approval on her watch. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump called the proposed deal another example of too few sources disseminating information to Americans, warning of too much concentration of power, manipulating people, telling them how to think. As president, if elected, he vowed to oppose it. against jobs-killing TPP, NAFTA and similar deals. Our jobs are fleeing the country, he said. going to Mexico. going to many other countries.

At press time, the findings were being summarily dismissed out of hand by roughly 45 percent of the population in a manner identical to that of Donald Trump.

7653|FANTASTIC! TRUMP'S 7 POINT PLAN To Reform Healthcare Begins With A Bombshell! » 100percentfedUp.com|Email HEALTHCARE REFORM TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

7666|Is This A New Escalation? BLACK Chemtrails Reported Around The World!|Is This A New Escalation? BLACK Chemtrails Reported Around The World! Please scroll down for video For many years there have been theories floating around about the potential dangers of chemtrails, the white stripes with a cloudlike appearance that can often be seen in the skies. Some have suggested that these chemtrails are not as innocent as most people tend to think and some people have even gone so far as to say that they may be biological and chemical agents. This kind of theory has often been dismissed in the past as faulty reasoning and paranoid thinking. The phenomenon that believers identify as chemtrails are nothing more than the perfectly innocent condensation trials left behind by all kind of air vehicles. However, recent sightings of highly unusual chemtrails might well challenge this particular line of thinking. Black chemtrails in the sky stump sceptics According to many witnesses from all across the world, the chemtrails or appearing in their local areas are not white anymore black. No scientific body or government has chosen to offer an explanation about the sudden change in the appearance of numerous trails in the sky, but many believe that it is irrefutable evidence that chemtrails are being utilised for chemical or biological testing on civilian populations . Sceptics have suggested that these unusual black trails might be nothing more than a shadows of a typical white condensation trail left by a plane. However, this theory has been robustly dismissed by others who have pointed out that clouds leave no shadows in the sky and therefore it would be impossible for a condensation trail left by a plane to do the same thing. Not all of the people who believe that chemtrails are a real phenomenon believe that they are used to covertly test chemical and biological weapons. Others have suggested that they are part of a weather modification technology, often referred to as HAARP. The chemtrails are being used to electrify portions of the sky so that they can be used for testing by scientists working in this field. Whatever the truth of the matter is, one thing is for sure; these black chemtrails cannot be easily explained away. This article (Is This A New Escalation?

It raises the prospect of the French capital turning into the new hub for thousands of asylum seekers seeking a new life in Britain. first official refugee camp is due to open within the next few days, and it is expected to become a magnet for even more refugees. The new facility will be men only, and only take 400 migrants at a time. Even then, they will only be able to stay for a maximum of ten weeks at a time. It will open close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub, from where high speed trains travel to and from London. A total of 5,596 people have been evacuated since the operation to raze the Jungle shantytown in Calais began on Monday morning.

Man sees 'weirdest thing EVER' while filming fall leaves. A Parkland County, Alberta, Canada resident has spotted what he believes are flying objects, orbs, and discs while operating a drone camera. The unnamed man was filming at Hasse Lake when he noticed this odd objects zooming through his frame while shooting footage of the fall foliage. The video, recorded with a Phantom3P drone, was sent to the MUTUAL UFO Network (MUFON). The man stated that it was ""the weirdest thing"" he has ever recorded. The odd object was not noticed until the drone operator viewed the video at home. He was operating the drone from 500 meters away and did not physically see the weird shapes. The home video shows a collection of white spheres and one darker object that appears as a disc . The object zoomed past the drone, swerved to the left and then vanished. It had to be moving at incredible speeds, as his camera was recording at 60 frames per second. The objects appear as a blur when a frame is paused. The man at first thought they must be birds, but then noticed birds in the frame that do not look anything like the objects.

7678|It Took Less Than 2 Hours For The New Email Investigation Story To Completely Collapse (VIDEO)|Hillary supporters can stop panicking. The reopening of the email investigation story blasted out by every hungry reporter and desperate Republican has already completely fallen apart. It took less than two hours. The initial headlines were as grim as they were overblown. Shortly before an official announcement, NBC News leaked the news that the FBI would be looking into newly discovered emails related to the previous Clinton investigation. NBC News: FBI re-opening investigation into Hillary private e-mail server Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) October 28, 2016 This was important because despite Republicans hanging every last one of their hopes on Hillary being indicted before the election, the FBI investigation found zero evidence of criminal wrongdoing. A new investigation made all those dashed hopes come rushing back. They. Freaked. Out. Especially Trump. Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) October 28, 2016 However, even as Trump took a meaningless victory lap, the story itself was falling apart. The bombshell turned out to be a dud. Over on MSNBC, veteran reporter Pete Williams did what almost no other reporter bothered to he got to the bottom of it. Pete Williams: Sr. officials separate investigation a device led to from Clinton Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 All the big things turned out to not exist. No, there is no evidence to suggest these new emails were covered up. No, they found anything incriminating. No, this a reopening of the case it was never closed to the begin with and this is a small update not a gamechanger. And perhaps most importantly these emails did not even come from Hillary Clinton . Bigger than Watergate? Hardly. Like Wikileaks before it, this non-scandal will be used on the right to give the appearance that Hillary Clinton is corrupt without providing any concrete proof beyond it. There is no big story here, but the conservative movement will use it as a pretext to continue harassing Clinton and her campaign with baseless accusations. FBI Director James Comey may have scored a few political points with his Republican colleagues, but his investigation will likely yield zero fresh controversies.

Half-heartedly back-peddling on the threat, Bennett, wrote in a text message to The Oklahoman that the comments were intended to be sarcastic, but that reiterated that Clinton was guilty of treason, punishable by death. Rep. Bennet is an outspoken Islamophobe, who has openly bragged about his hatred of Muslims, claiming the Prophet Mohammed only teaches violence and paints Christianity as being dialectical opposition to Islam. Just last week, he presided over the waste of taxpayer dollars for an interim study on radical Islam in Oklahoma , a witch-hunt which ended with him declaring a local imam and the leader of the local Council of American-Islamic relations as terrorists. hatred cannot be tolerated and his threats should be directly addressed; a public official who threatens the future president is not a sarcastic matter.

Being intersectional means to love and support people where they are and assist them in their efforts at gaining a better understanding of intersectional social justice. While the work ultimately lies on the individual to read/research further once you enlighten them, you can't do that if you brow beat them for being ignorant.

Ambassador Young is asking for a written response. His letter was also sent to the CEO of the American Water Works Association, David LaFrance. clear to me is that we need a repeal of water fluoridation law, and hearings to look into how fluoridation has continued all these years, long after there were plenty of reasons to end it, Ambassador Young wrote. This is a civil rights issue, and the people have the right to have the full story given to them, rather than highly edited, misleading talking points. Young also addressed the sketchy nature of the pro-fluoridation argument when he wrote, When story keeps changing, there are quite often motivations behind their changed stance that may not be aligned with the best interests of the public. The story offered by water fluoridation promoters keeps changing. There are key groups such as seniors, kidney patients, diabetics, communities of color, thyroid patients and people who drink a lot of water due to their occupation that are especially effected by Fluoridegate.

Boehner, an Ohio Republican, made clear he would support the nominee. But that doesn¹t mean Boehner supports what Trump is pitching on the campaign trail. Asked, rapid fire, whether he supported Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S., his proposal to build a wall on the border of Mexico and the New York billionaire¹s plan to aggressively use tariffs to attack foreign trade competitors, Boehner repeatedly answered with one word: ""No."" He also said Trump¹s foreign policy stance, laid out in a speech two weeks ago, didn't align with his views. Still, Boehner said, ""Anybody who doesn't think Donald Trump can win, just watch."" Boehner¹s comments come two weeks after saying, during a question-and-answer session at Stanford University, that he and Trump were ""texting buddies."" It was at that same event that he called then-GOP presidential candidate and regular Boehner tormenter Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, ""Lucifer in the flesh."" Cruz has since suspended his campaign, clearing the way for Trump to secure the title of ""presumptive nominee"" for the party. Boehner, in an unsolicited comment, couldn't hide his feelings on that front. ""Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win,"" he said. As all eyes in Washington were on Trump¹s meetings with top GOP lawmakers, Boehner weighed in on the decision by his replacement as speaker -- the lawmaker Boehner pushed, lobbied and cajoled to take the job, Paul Ryan -- not to immediately endorse Trump. ""I think Paul was just being cautious,"" Boehner said, adding that he ""doesn't have any doubt"" things will ""get smoothed over."" He also made clear he had no regrets about his decision to leave Congress.

7721|THE CLINTON/VATICAN/TEHRAN AXIS|Robert Spencer Breitbart reported Saturday that among the many revealing and damning emails that WikiLeaks has revealed from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, one has White House chief of staff Denis McDonough responding favorably to an email forwarded to him by Podesta from a leftwing organization that said it was arranging meetings with Catholic prelates to urge them to press U.S. senators to vote for the Iran Treaty. This plan was apparently hatched by Fred Rotondaro, chairman of the far-Left and Catholic-in-name-only Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good (CACG), as well as a senior fellow with Soros-funded Islamophobia propaganda organ, the Center for American Progress. Rotondaro wrote to Podesta and others in the Clinton camp: John, I thought you might be interested in this report from the CACG exec director Chris Hale on efforts to have the Catholic org community promote the Iran Treaty. There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach some working class voters, Fred Hale wrote in his report: Our advertisement began running on National Catholic Reporter and Commonweal yesterday. Right now, when you click the advertisement, the link takes you to 60 Day to Stop A War Take Action website. From there, you are able to dial into your Member of Congress and request them to support the Iran Deal. At some point today, that link will change to our own website, which will list all the names, simple talking points, and give people a chance to dial in three elected officials (their one US Representatives and two Senators).

Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely. This is an extremely educating and enlightening show.

7742|Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside|Trick-Or-Treaters Get Their Socks Rocked By BADASS Hillary Pumpkin Outside Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This An incredible video is being shared on social media after someone wanted to go political with their jack-o-lantern carving this year. Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. Halloween is a fun time for many people especially families with younger ones. However, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. Proving just that is a video shared to the Facebook page called Uncle Misguided Children , which shows how one person went political with theirs. As can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. Making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of Hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison where she belongs. Within just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. However, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. As it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. In fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words Hillary 4 Prison on their creations as well:|2022-09-24 14:00:00|FAKE|Emily Parker|The Chronicle|297094|90244|383|3086|Indonesia|English|2022-09-16 22:00:00|Sin tipo|1|True|2012400|1350000|1595|6.383333333333334

7749|BREAKING: Hillary’s State Department Spent $9.2 Million Hiring the Terrorists Who Attacked Americans in Benghazi|What difference, at this point, does it make? Remember those infamous and wretched words? Of course you do. We all do. Those were the words uttered by Hillary Clinton when she was desperately trying to spin her way through a committee hearing on Benghazi. And as anyone not named Hillary Clinton or anyone not on her corrupt payroll knows, it makes a lot of difference . This because Americans died. They died at the hands of terrorists on watch. New information is now out about some of the individuals who were paid to guard/protect state department employees at the special missions compound where the terrorist attack occurred and not pretty. Turns out state department spent $9.2 million on a contract for guards, many of whom turned out to be the very terrorists who attacked the compound, killing our ambassador and other Americans in the process. Via Fox News . Many of the local Libyans who attacked the consulate on the night of Sept. 11, 2012, were the actual guards that the State Department under Hillary Clinton hired to protect the Consulate in Benghazi, Tiegen told Fox News. The guards were unvetted and were locals with basically no background at all in providing security. Most of them never had held a job in security in the past. Blue Mountain Libya, at the time of being awarded the contract by our State Department, had no employees so they quickly had to find people to work, regardless of their backgrounds, he said. One former guard who witnessed the attack, Weeam Mohamed, confirmed in an email sent to the Citizens Commission on Benghazi and obtained by Fox News, that at least four of the guards hired by Blue Mountain took part in the attack after opening doors to allow their confederates in. In the U.S. Mission, there were four people [who] belonged to the battalion February 17, Mohamed wrote to the Commission, an independent body formed with Accuracy in Media to investigate the attack and the handling of it. Again, it makes a lot of difference.|2022-10-02 23:00:00|FAKE|Avery Kim|Echo News|592475|4475|237|9963|Bangladesh|English|2022-10-01 06:00:00|Columna de humor|1|True|2588400|2736000|1982|3.95

(Photo by AFP) Former US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced Republican nominee Donald Trump as a political coward over a voter suppression report. Sanders condemned Trump after a report that the Republican's presidential campaign has three ""voter suppression"" drives intended to lower turnout for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to help Trump winning the White House. ""Anybody who is suppressing the vote because they know that those people will vote against them is a political coward,"" the Vermont senator tweeted. If you have the guts to run for office on your ideas @ realDonaldTrump , then you run for office at all, he said in another tweet. A senior adviser to Trump acknowledged in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that the Republican team has ""three major voter suppression operations underway."" Sanders a former primary rival of Clinton suspended his campaign in July and endorsed the former secretary of state, despite leaked emails that showed top officials at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) privately planned to undermine presidential campaign. Sanders had earlier said that he would not endorse Clinton for president until they meet and he could measure her commitment to combating wealth inequality, and other issues that powered his presidential campaign. emphasis on US income inequality and the influence of corporate money on elections and the government helped him attract millions of voters to his campaign.

7768|"Hillary Clinton staffer: ""Black Voters Are Stupid"""|A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being stupid. The Wikileaks email ID 31909 , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured many black faces. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with outburst, writing in the email, Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with. I guess plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie, writes Budowsky. I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf, adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as super predators.

7771|What Scientists Found Inside This 800-Year-Old Pot... Is Changing History!|Share on Facebook In 2008, on a dig in the First Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, archaeologists made a small but stunning discovery: a tiny clay pot. Though it might not have seemed very impressive at first glimpse, this little piece of pottery was determined to be about 800 years old. And inside that pot? Something that changes how we're looking at extinction, preservation, and food storage, as well as how humans have influenced the planet in their time on it. It's amazing to think that a little clay pot buried in the ground 800 years ago would still be relevant today, but it's true! It's actually brought an extinct species of squash that was presumed to be lost forever. Thank our Indigenous Ancestors! Even they knew what preservation meant. They knew the importance of the future, Is it not amazing that they are affecting our walks of life even to this day? Here it is! The pot was unearthed on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, where it had laid buried for the past 800 years. Inside, archaeologists found a stash of seeds. The seeds were probably buried in the pot as a method of storing food supplies. They were determined to be an old, now-extinct species of squash. Now, seven years after making this stunning discovery, students in Winnipeg decided to plant the 800-year-old to everyone's amazement, something grew! The squash was named Gete-Okosomin. It means cool old squash in the Menominee language. (Respect to the science people for respecting the indigenous people who's land this was found on, we see your good nature!) Now, they're working to cultivate the squash so that it doesn't go again. It may be just a humble squash, but it's also a symbol of first nations' community and history, as well as a fascinating look into how amazing plants can be. It just goes to show you that plants can be pretty and that sometimes, history has a funny way of coming back around. The Wheel of Life really stands out in this instance of history. Our Indigenous roots are strong and very much tied to the land. I was taught once that the people of Turtle Island were keepers of the land, not owners. I feel like this Squash is proof of that teaching. Check out the original story & the role of White Earth Land Recovery Project (where seed keepers tend to these seeds) or Winona LaDuke (who named the squash)!

For many of us with young children, you probably woke up this morning asking yourself, How am I supposed to explain this to my children? I, Melania Trump, am asking myself the same thing. How can any of us metabolize what happened to a ten-year-old? Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are, or do I let him enjoy his childhood, his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is broken while Donald is stuck in there? Many of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous, sexist climate. In the case of my son, the biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy. How am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully, and also his father? And how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot, just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable, just like been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life? And when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all. What am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud, nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them, including me, his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man? It seems like always on the tip of my tongue these days; that Donald Trump is a bad man. But I bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said send me back to Slovenia if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country. concerned for the world my son has to grow up in, and that his father is the next leader of the free world. What have we done?

7794|Juror in Oregon militia trial dismissed for bias: judge|Reuters A juror in the trial of seven militia members charged with seizing a U.S. wildlife refuge in Oregon at gunpoint earlier this year was dismissed for bias, a federal judge said on Wednesday. Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the case agreed to the dismissal of the juror, who formerly worked for the federal Bureau of Land Management, after U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said the juror would be questioned more closely about comments he may have made about his bias. a new jury, a new day, a new start, Brown said. Brown said deliberations by the jury would start over. An alternate will step in for the dismissed juror. The attorney for Ammon Bundy, the leader of those charged, asked the court in a motion on Wednesday morning to dismiss the juror in question and order the jury to begin deliberations again or declare a mistrial. The integrity came under scrutiny on Tuesday when it sent the judge a letter saying one juror admitted being very biased as deliberations began last week. Can a juror, a former employee of the Bureau of Land Management, who opens their remarks in deliberations by stating am very biased be considered an impartial judge in this the letter stated, according to the motion by lawyer, Marcus Mumford. While it was unclear whether the supposed bias of the juror, identified as Juror No. 11, was for or against the government, Mumford had said further questioning of the person was needed. Brown interviewed the juror in private on Tuesday and said she found no basis for determining he was biased. Prosecutors had previously opposed additional interrogation of the jury.|2022-10-11 03:00:00|FAKE|Aria Shah|The Pulse|619551|40502|356|8082|France|English|2022-09-08 00:00:00|Análisis|0|True|579600|3441600|1609|5.933333333333334

From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. President Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. Video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he believe in the possibility: Well, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, not as if just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too.

Home surveillance footage shows Oyindasola was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker. Police say Oyindasola then tried to feed the child, and when her attempt was unsuccessful, she proceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the mouth. Col.

The suspects were arrested one day before the match which gathered over 60,000 fans. ISIS wants any operation that could result in the highest number of victims, said interior ministry spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki. A security official, General Bassam Attiyah, said a vehicle carrying around 400 kilograms of explosives was found near the stadium. He added that the suspects had planned to either target people in the parking lot or fans watching the match. Another equally horrifying scenario would have occurred, he added, had the device exploded whilst the spectators were exiting the stadium. He noted that the blast radius would have been something around 1,100 meters which would have covered an area of almost 800,000 square meters. MORE...

7809|Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash|Little-Loved by Scholars, Trump Also Gets Little of Their Cash Peter Olsen-Phillips, Chronicle of Higher Education, November 7, 2016 no secret that campaign contributions from higher education have favored Democratic candidates for years. When it comes to the current presidential race, however, data show that the gap between left and right has grown from a rift into a chasm. A Chronicle analysis of Federal Election Commission data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics shows Donald Trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, drew from higher-education professionals over comparable time periods. Across higher education, donations in congressional and Senate races showed a ratio of Democratic to Republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidential-campaign cycles. But support for Mr. Trump stood at less than 8 percent of what Senator McCain raised from higher-ed professionals, and around 4 percent of the donations that Mr. Romney pulled in over the same time period, once the figures were adjusted for inflation. As of June 30, faculty members and others who work in higher education had donated $76,668 to Mr. campaign committee and to support super committees that can raise and spend unlimited funds. By comparison, people working in academe had given $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton. Those figures account for donations of at least $200 that the Center for Responsive Politics has determined come from people associated with higher education. They are the most-recent figures available. {snip}|2022-09-22 05:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Express Tribune|477611|27748|116|1910|Italy|English|2022-09-16 18:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|0|True|1335600|1807200|1611|1.9333333333333333
7810|Anxiety grows among GOP congressional staffers|Anxiety grows among GOP congressional staffers By Wayne Madsen Posted on October 28, 2016 by Wayne Madsen With their bosses away campaigning, some for their political lives, a number of Republican staffers in Congress are growing anxious over their future employment. With the Senate now favored to be transferred to Democratic control, GOP staffers for members up for re-election on November 8, as well as Republican staffers assigned to various Senate committees and subcommittees, are shopping around their resumes. Although more senior staff can always expect to find employment with many lobbying firms and policy-wonkish institutes and foundations, that is not necessarily the case with younger staffers who may find their future options being limited to baristas and Uber drivers. On the House of Representatives side, Republicans are expected to lose a number of seats in a Democratic wave but GOP control of the House, barring a dramatic shift, is expected to remain in Republican hands. However, staffers for GOP members who are in close races or facing certain defeat are also scurrying around Washington looking for future employment. In what could be termed poetic justice, many Republican staffers who helped push their memes against government entitlement programs, including unemployment benefits, may be among the first in line at District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland state unemployment offices come December.

Once I finally went to bed I found myself tossing and turning so at 3:30 I said screw heading to the office. My beloved Cubbies had just won the World Series, defeating the Cleveland Indians in what is likely to go down as one of the most EPIC game 7 battles in the history of professional baseball. The Cubs won a World Series since 1908, making this Championship something we Cubs fans could only dream about until it actually happened last night. As prediction hub FiveThirtyEight put it just a few days the chances were slim. How slim? Slimmer than the odds of Trump winning next Tuesday. An impossible scenario just become very possible. And fortunately for America, another seemingly impossible scenario is now suddenly started to look very possible. A Hillary Clinton indictment is now likely . This coming via FBI sources telling Fox News host Bret Baier that the FBI is moving towards what is likely an indictment. report includes the following key points . 1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary secret server on Anthony laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is likely in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, barring some obstruction in some way from the Justice Department. 5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it. a pretty strong case for indictment. Of course, the corrupted DOJ can still do everything in its power to block justice, but it now appears the FBI is throwing DOJ demands out the window. Gonna be an interesting few days ahead, folks.

According to the NBC News Exit Polls in the five Democratic contests Tuesday, there has been a 15-point increase since 2008 in the percentage of voters who describe their political ideology as ""liberal."" On Tuesday, about one-third of Democrats described themselves as 9-point drop since now fewer than one in 10 characterize their political thinking as conservative. Among Republicans in four of the five states Tuesday (North Carolina was excluded because it did not have the comparable trend data) there has been growth since 2008 in the percentage describing their political ideology as ""conservative."" In 2008, 63 percent of Republicans across the four states self-identified as conservatives. On Tuesday, 73 percent did so, an overall increase of 10 points.

7823|AUSTRIAN DISGRACE: No jail for Muslim migrant who dumped his own baby in the middle of the road after he got drunk and enraged|BY CHRISTINE WILLIAMS The West has in effect developed a two-tier legal system for Muslims. The article below is about a baby being dumped in the road, with the Muslim migrant perpetrator escaping jail time. This follows another shocking recent report about the rape of a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna by a Muslim refugee from Iraq; his sentence was overturned because the judge accepted, outrageously, that the man thought the little boy consented. Our senses have seemingly gone numb to Muslim crime. This is similar to the phenomenon of how Muslim Arab violence against Israel is tolerated, as suggested by Middle East scholar Ephraim Karsh: The sight of Arabs killing Jews (or other Arabs for that matter) is hardly news; while the sight of Jews killing Arabs is a man-bites-dog anomaly that cannot be tolerated. comment is based on the unflattering principle of low expectations toward Muslims, which is a costly malady, as Western civilized society is slowly descending into the barbarism seen in Islamic states. Less than two decades ago, no one could could have imagined reports such as these: Violent asylum seekers hurl chairs and throw punches in fight that left five in hospital; a 90-year-old woman gets raped by a Muslim; a 79-year-old woman visiting her grave also gets raped by a Muslim; up to a million girls in the UK are sexually assaulted by Muslim rape gangs; and crime has seized Europe, with coverups of Muslim crime in the U.S. as well. No jail time for asylum seeker who dumped baby in road, by Paul Gillingwater, The Local , October 19, 2016: The 27-year-old had been living in an asylum centre in Floridsdorf district and had already been given several warnings for being drunk and violent.

7840|Women won't earn the same as men for another two centuries - report|"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 11:40 UTC © Joshua Lott / Reuters It will take close to two centuries for women to earn the same as men, according to the World Economic Forum's latest report. The annual Global Gender Gap Report was released Tuesday and found economic disparity between the sexes is on the rise. When looking at income and employment, we are back to similar levels of inequality seen during the 2008 financial crash. ""At the current rate of change, and given the widening economic gender gap since last year, it will not be closed for another 170 years,"" the report read. The Gender Gap Index uses economics, education, health and political empowerment to rank 144 countries that have enough available data to use. Last year's report estimated it would take 118 years for economic equality to be achieved. Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden were the best countries on the Global Gender Gap Index having closed the gender gap in more than 80 percent of cases, but all still have disparities between the sexes. Rwanda and Ireland came fifth and sixth in the index. The UK came 20th and the US came 45th, falling 17 places from last year. Yemen came last. ""There also continues to be a persistent wage gap in paid work,"" the report says. ""Women's average earnings are almost half those of men, with average global earned income for women and men estimated at US$10,778 and $19,873, respectively. Countries that perform well in this dimension of gender parity span all regional and income groups."" To examine economic participation and opportunity, the report looks at the ratio of female and male workers, wage equality for similar work and the ratio of women to men in various roles. The greatest gap between the sexes was found in political empowerment. The first Index was conducted in 2006 to track gender disparities and countries' progress over time."|2022-09-26 08:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|National Courier|945148|34133|303|6966|Ukraine|English|2022-09-24 15:00:00|Entrevista|0|True|2016000|2163600|1855|5.05

Prayer alone is not what comes to mind when you think of America where we are told to leave God at home and out of our pledge. There has never been a more crucial time to look to God, as our nation is being divided and torn apart by the selfish greed of a corrupt society with leaders that lead from behind, and hide their dark secrets right in plain they can. Now Walmart has brought us a Thanksgiving commercial that is a huge reminder of what is good, and what is right. A reminder of what a good foundation is made up of. Being grateful, family, and prayer. Most of together. The 30-second ad, which at World Series rates cost Walmart $500,000 features the diversity of Americas families and the camaraderie of its service members as they gather, pray and enjoy the bonds of family. A commercial showing everyone praying before eating??? great job Walmart!! #Walmart Deplorable Jack (@DeplorableJackL) November 3, 2016 Then their final come together and take a moment to reflect on what truly thankful for this holiday season. Friends, family and the chance to spend time with the ones we love. Walmart would like to give thanks to all of our Veterans and Active Duty Service Members at home and oversees this holiday Walmart has invited a spirit of thanksgiving with just a few seconds of video. Can you imagine if everyday Americans brought just a few seconds of thanksgiving into their lives daily? What a difference it would make. It could change the very state in right now. Where everything is about oneself and selfish desires. A generation of self-absorbed selfie taking kids who think they do hard things. For would make a HUGE difference.

Trump has only won 6% of those voters. Yes. These are people that have already voted, and these Republicans are not just saying it to pollsters, but doing it in Florida. These are voters that are not waiting for election day.

My car was keyed three times when I had an anti-Obama bumper sticker on it. My car was never keyed before I had that sticker and never again after I removed it. What a From CNN : Los Angeles police are looking for the man who destroyed Donald Hollywood Walk of Fame star with a sledgehammer and a pick ax. Police tweeted Wednesday that seeking the help in identifying the vandalism suspect. The man identified himself as James Otis, an heir to the Otis elevator fortune , in an interview with CNN on the Walk of Fame Wednesday morning. He said he was doing it to help the 11 women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them, and other victims who he said could come forward in the future. I had four or five family members sexually assaulted, and terribly upset that we have a presidential nominee become sort of a poster child of sexual violence, Otis said. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment and not yet gotten a response. Otis managed to remove the gold emblem from the middle of the star and damage the star itself and the area around it. The shape of the star was still recognizable after Otis had vandalized it. Leron Gubler, President/CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said work to repair the star will happen immediately but the star is expected to remain covered for several days. Gubler said the Chamber is working with the police and intends to prosecute to the full extent of the law. When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark, Gubler said. Otis said he plans to sell parts of star and donate the proceeds to the women who have been sexually assaulted by Mr. Trump. I know I can sell it. I think I can get over $1 million for this star, to be distributed to these women and many others that will be going forward, he said. Otis noted he previously auctioned off personal items belonging to Mahatma Gandhi, saying he donated all the money to countries that were fighting dictatorships with non-violent strategies. That 2009 auction of possessions attracted news coverage at the time, including by CNN , and items were sold for $1.8 million. Otis said he knows he might be arrested though he want that to happen.

'We asked for humanitarian aid to render support to refugees, that came to the Iraqi Kurdistan from other regions of the country, as well as from Syria,' Bakir said. The situation in the Kurdish area of Iraq has reached its critical point. Have they addressed someone else, or just Russia? Anton Mardasov, a military expert at the Institute of Innovative Development, head of the Department of the Middle Eastern conflicts , commented Pravda.Ru on the issue. The Iraqi Kurds had great relations with the Soviet Union , at the time Primakov headed the Kurdish direction. Masud Barzani (President of the Kurdish autonomy in Iraq)studied in the USSR. Thus, there are some ties. But any deliveries to the Iraqi Kurdistan require agreement with the central Iraqi government in Baghdad. For the moment it's not quite clear what the Kurds are asking for. It should be noted that there are several US military facilities in Kurdistan. What is more, huge oil industry is operating in the Iraqi Kurdistan, it means they do not have financial difficulties and can afford buying everything they need. Thus, I believe it's a political step. Maybe they'd like to get on the Americans' nerves. The situation is very difficult. So, we should cooperate and carry on a diplomatic and political dialogue, but real steps should be calculated very thoroughly.

7867|King Rufus Found Buried Under Parking Lot Near Beaulieu Motor Museum|"Saturday, 29 October 2016 Another clue was an arrow in the lung area. King William II Rufus was the son of William the Conqueror and King of England from 1087 to 1100. Described as uncouth, barbaric, lacking both morals and ethics, addicted to vice, and definitely not the most popular king, he was killed by an arrow to the lungs-probably shot by one of his own men. Although his body was left where it lay when he was shot in the New Forest, it was said it was later removed to Winchester Cathedral. From there, the bones were scattered around during the English Civil War and later put in a giant mortuary chest along with Kings Egbert, Ethelwulfe, and others. But the body of King William II Rufus was actually identified at the Motor City Museum, which is near the New Forest area where King Rufus was shot. Apparently, the king was so popular that they just dug a shallow grave in the New Forest area and tossed him in. The grave was discovered when the museum was breaking ground in its parking lot for a new area to display its 1895 Knight auto. The workers came upon some bones (apparently the citizens who buried King Rufus didn't bother with a coffin) and sent them to the British Museum for identification. Since the royal Norman DNA was on file, it was determined to be Rufus from process of elimination. And someone had carved ""Rufus"" on the femur.

788|Why Hillary Clinton wins even when she loses|"We're not with her. That's what Democratic voters in West Virginia said Tuesday night, with Hillary Clinton losing to Bernie Sanders. Although the loss was not unexpected, Clinton's campaign sure seems like one long slog of speeches, handshakes and voter selfies on the way toward the 2016 convention in Philadelphia. This extended campaign, however, is actually the best thing that could have happened to Clinton. She has benefited enormously from the presence of Sanders. Now Team Clinton must build on lessons learned from the primaries as they prepare to run against Donald Trump in the general election. Then look at Clinton these days, speaking out about income inequality, campaign finance reform, and the evils of the big banks on Wall Street. Hmm, where could those winning themes have come from? From Bernie, thank you, who proved that progressive voters are tired of not having a voice in national politics. His success pushed Clinton to the left, and she is a better candidate for it. Despite Clinton's experience as first lady, senator, and secretary of state, there is an understandable tendency of many Democratic voters to be wary of anything resembling a Clinton ""coronation."|2022-09-11 01:00:00|REAL|Benjamin Singh|The Informer|376221|86633|407|7401|Ukraine|English|2022-09-06 19:00:00|Entrevista exclusiva|1|True|842400|475200|1192|6.783333333333333

789|Presumptive Nominee? Trump Indiana Win Creates Big Challenge to Unite Party|"Donald Trump delivered a knock-out punch to Sen. Ted Cruz, winning an astounding victory in Indiana Tuesday night. The state was Cruz's last stand, but he was unable to deliver. That means Trump is now the presumptive GOP nominee for president. ""It really looks like a massive victory and looks like we win all 57 delegates,"" a subdued Trump told supporters Tuesday night. With Trump now only about 200 delegates away from what he needs to secure the nomination, even RNC Chairman Reince Priebus acknowledged that Trump is the party's presumptive nominee. ""We need to unite and focus on defeating Hillary Clinton,"" he tweeted. Meanwhile, a disappointed Cruz announced he's suspending his campaign, saying, ""We gave it everything we got, but the voters chose another path."" And now it is clear the path is a Washington outsider, with Republicans preferring a non-politician, a brash and outspoken billionaire businessman over the Tea Party candidate. In New York, Trump told his supporters America needs to win again because it's been losing all the time. ""We lose with our military--we can't beat ISIS. We lose with trade. We lose with borders. We lose with everything,"" he said. ""We're not going to lose, we're going to start winning again and we're going to win bigly, believe me."" But the question now is can Trump win his race for the White House against Hillary Clinton? The former secretary of state has 92 percent of the delegates she needs to secure her party's nomination. But Democrat socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders -- who upset Clinton to win the Indiana primary -- has yet to concede defeat, insisting said he has momentum. ""I understand that Secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over. I've got some bad news for her,"" Sanders told supporters. But with many super delegates already pledged to Clinton, it seems mathematically impossible for Sanders to win his party's nomination. Nevertheless, he promises to stay in the race. Although their party conventions and official nominations are still more than two months away, Trump and Clinton will now focus their campaign efforts against one another."|2022-09-25 09:00:00|REAL|Ella Sharma|City Times|439962|87710|335|2744|Brazil|English|2022-09-10 18:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|2080800|817200|2119|5.583333333333333

""Dr. King died with his work unfinished and it is up to us to see through."" Sanders argued that King is not just a historic figure, but someone whose moral compass should guide people today. Repeating the phrase ""I think if he were here today,"" Sanders argued that if King were alive today, he would be supporting many of his presidential positions. ""As we celebrate his life it is terribly important to me that we don't just look at him as a museum figure, somebody in the past,"" the Vermont senator said. ""It is important to me that we look at his vision, to see the America he wanted to see.""

As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29% of Latinos, 9% of African Americans and 49% of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton. How could they have got it so wrong?

7907|Comment on FBI: No link between Trump and Russian government by Christian Zionist|"Posted on November 1, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments For Hillary Clinton and her accomplice and protector, the Obama administration, Russia is the new, all-purpose bogeyman. They say the Russian government is the hacker of those revealing and embarrassing DNC, Hillary and Podesta emails that WikiLeaks has been releasing. Hillary even accused Donald Trump of being in cahoots with Moscow. The latest accuser is longtime Democratic strategist James Carville. As reported by Edund Kozak for PoliZette , in an appearance on MSNBC yesterday, Oct. 31, 2016, Carville attacked the FBI for reopening its criminal investigation into Hillary emails, calling it part of a vast conspiracy to subvert American democracy. (See Weinered: FBI reopens investigation into Hillary emails ) Carville raged: This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election. unprecedented the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy! [FBI Director James] Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans. We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked. As noted by Kozak, Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency [KGB] was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton, FBI-organized conspiracy. Now, the New York Times reports (via ZeroHedge ) that in an investigation into possible involvement in the 2016 presidential election, the FBI concludes that no evidence that Trump is connected with the Russian government: For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead which they ultimately came to doubt about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. Hey, James Carville, you conniving POS.

AFP, citing U.S. officials, reported Friday morning that a Russian fighter jet flew dangerously close to a U.S. jet in airspace over eastern Syria on Oct. 17, nearly two weeks prior. A Russian jet escorting a larger spy aircraft flew into the vicinity of the U.S. warplane, moving to inside half a mile from the American plane, according to Air Force Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigian. #BREAKING Russian, US jets had near miss over Syria: US officials AFP news agency (@AFP) October 28, 2016 I would attribute it to not having the necessary situational awareness given all those platforms operating together, Harrigian further stated, according to AFP. An unnamed defense official said that the Russian aircraft was close enough you could feel the jet wash of the plane passing by. The U.S. and Russia have set up a line of communication to avoid clashes in airspace over Syria. In this incident, the American pilot reportedly attempted to communicate with the Russian warplane but was unsuccessful. Harrigian also reported an increase in close encounters between American and Russian military jets in the region in the past six weeks. He said that Russian jets have intentionally flown close to U.S. warplanes about once every 10 days. Tensions between the United States and Russia have been exacerbated over the situation in Syria in recent weeks, following a failed ceasefire deal and suspension of communications between the two countries. Russian and Syrian jets have bombed civilians and U.S.-backed rebels in Aleppo, drawing ire from America. Moscow has threatened to shoot down coalition jets that target Bashar forces with air strikes in Syria, after reports indicated that the Obama administration would consider targeting Syrian government forces with strikes.|2022-10-10 10:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Observer|445670|48261|441|1560|Indonesia|English|2022-09-08 14:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|3380400|630000|1957|7.35

7941|UK announces new troop deployment near Russia's borders|Military British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon (Photo by AFP) British Defense Minister Michael Fallon says the UK is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the Baltic region in Europe to support its NATO allies in the face of a more assertive Russia. Fallon told a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain would send 800 soldiers to Estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe. Backed by a rising defense budget, this deployment of air, land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in NATO, supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance, Fallon said. NATO had announced in July that it would deploy, on a rotational basis, four multinational battalions to Poland and the Baltic Latvia and deter what it referred to as any Russian incursion. During his address at the meeting, Fallon also said that four British Typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to Romania under the NATO Southern Air Policing mission, which is supposed to protect the Baltic states' airspace against possible attacks from Russia. This is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence, Fallon had said in an earlier interview. This is not simply a is a serious military presence. The move is likely to draw criticism from Moscow, which has been angered by military buildup on its Western borders. The US-led military alliance cut its ties with Moscow in 2014 and has been reinforcing its presence near borders ever since. The UK and Russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues, mainly the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. The two military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations, with Britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept Russian bombers and naval fleets. The latest of those encounters occurred on Thursday, when the Russian aircraft career Admiral Kuznetsov and its seven-ship task force were shadowed by two British warships on a course to sail through the North Sea and English Channel, on their way to Syria.

She added: Apparently, he had not suffered any obvious physical injuries but he could have been slowly poisoned, which is why the results of toxicology tests from his post-mortem are so important. [bolding by me] Activated charcoal -- which is black and readily available to anyone -- is used to treat poisoning, and could cause black vomit also.

7947|Democrats & Republicans Just Joined Forces To Condemn Comey’s Partisan Smears|Comments I learned exclusively tonight that the Democratic Coalition Against Trump is being joined by University of Minnesota Law Professor Richard Painter in a non-partisan joint campaign to mount a public campaign against an expedite a response to their parallel complaints against FBI Director James Comey for his partisan witch-hunt of Hillary Clinton. Painter is a former Bush Administration White House Counsel who served as ethics counsel to the President. Richard Painter and I connected this evening, and we are sending out the message clearly that the FBI behavior is a non-partisan issue, and we will be sending out a joint press release tomorrow morning accordingly, said Scott Dworkin, Senior Adivsor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. Both parties seek to prevent future political interference by top federal law enforcement agency into partisan elections. We plan to make joint television and other media appearances together with Professor Painter, said Dworkin who plans to participate in the broadcasts, or alongside other members of the DCAT. Each independently made similar complaints to Department of Office of Special ruling about the FBI recent memo . Because the memo has intruded on this presidential election, DCAT and Painter are alleging that FBI Director violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits pernicious partisan use of office by federal employees or officials. The FBI Director ignored Justice Department policy guidance which proscribes public investigatory actions within 60-days of an election. a policy that has been respected across parties and administrations for decades to keep justice and elections un-entwined. Justice officials specifically advised Comey of the policy . He sent a mea culpa letter to other FBI agents just hours after the election-impacting memo. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed the first reported Hatch Act complaint against FBI Director Comey in the wake of his unusual memo Friday afternoon. Yesterday, Professor Richard Painter filed his own Hatch Act and ethics complaint against the FBI Director and an ethics complaint over the same memo, which is also drawing the ire of the career professionals at the top federal investigatory agency.|2022-10-10 19:00:00|FAKE|Amelia Rivera|The Chronicle|206695|95398|294|9258|Thailand|English|2022-09-27 07:00:00|Noticia destacada|0|True|2246400|3412800|2225|4.9

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted: A great day in our campaign just got even better. FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe @CNNPolitics Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 28, 2016 The problem with the idea that the emails will save Donald Trump and the Republican Party is that Clinton was beating Trump while the FBI did their first investigation into her emails. Clinton has led Trump all through the Congressional hearings into her emails. She led Trump throughout the FBI investigation into her emails. Clinton won the Democratic nomination with her emails being a story. The point is that Hillary emails a big issue to the majority of voters. The people who Republicans in this election care about her emails. When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. Republicans get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. Hillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day.

During the week that ranged from Oct. 16-23, those headlines included additional revelations from trove of Pedesta emails regarding Hillary campaign, as well as various takes on how to vote this time around, and news of the ongoing Dakota Access pipeline protest. As for the how-to-vote issue, Jonathan Mitchell posted a short and direct comment under this story about famous hawkishness when it comes to envisioning and enacting American foreign policy on the world stage: Reader Helen Hanna, like many others who took in Robert piece titled The Incalculable Damage of Doing Whatever It Takes to Win, noticed and remarked upon gloss-over of Democratic Party and in particular Hillary and Bill proclivity for doing damage in the interest of maintaining power: That said, not as though commenters were about to give Donald Trump a pass, either. Take Ignatius J. rejoinder to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne 5-point plan to defeat Islam, as Trump and his team conceived of it (and Juan Cole wrote of it): Touché. Another point of contention on the comment boards last week had to do with how to evaluate and by extension Julian latest release of documents in the Pedesta emails. Though some commentators like Naomi Klein and Glenn Greenwald have spoken up about particular aspects of current m.o., in the thread under Alexander Reed Truthdigger of the Week column on Assange , reader JJG noted how, like him or not, Assange and his organization are providing a public service that professionals working in the mainstream press (who are supposed to be skilled in curating and redacting sensitive material) are not generally delivering on these days: give Opa Westphal the last word this time, ending on an up note (in terms of the shout-out to other commenters) and a cautionary note at the same time.

Bush was surging back against challenger Bill Clinton, a special prosecutor raised new charges against Bush in the Iran-Contra probe, prompting Clinton to claim he was running against a culture of corruption. Many Republicans claimed that the indictment made by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh against former Reagan-era Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger the weekend before the 1992 election cost Bush a second term. The indictment, later thrown out, challenged claim that he did not know about a controversial arms-for-hostages deal that dogged the Reagan-Bush administration. When it came, Clinton seized on it, saying for example, Secretary note clearly shows that President Bush has not been telling the truth when he says he was out of the loop. Clinton added, It demonstrates that President Bush knew and approved of President secret deal to swap arms for hostages.|2022-09-20 14:00:00|FAKE|Avery Kim|Global Insight|626398|79497|468|4685|Uganda|English|2022-09-04 09:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1666800|266400|1087|7.8

During a panel discussion on Wednesday's Anderson Cooper 360, Republican strategist and CNN regular Ana Navarro went off on Newt Gingrich over his meltdown on The Kelly during which he angrily accused Kelly of being fascinated with sex . After Cooper referred to Gingrich's rant as ironic, Navarro jumped to take issue, 'correcting' the host before torching Gingrich over the treatment of his wife: I think the word you were looking for was Remember Newt wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media [...] Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce.

Dominion Voting Systems brags on its home page that Together with our customers, we strive to change elections for the better! Wikipedia currently reports that Dominion provides voting machines to 22 states. If you hit the link to this statement, however, the supporting post has now been taken down. Dominion Voting Systems is owned by George Soros an internationalist billionaire who is openly supporting Hillary Clinton and donated to her campaign dozens of millions of dollars. We now know that the machines are already flipping out votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton in Texas, Illinois, North Carolina and other states. The people working at the voting boots always find out some WHATEVER excuses while so far there been a single vote switched from Hillary to Trump. Soros is also said to control a British company called Smartmatic, which had something to do with election fraud in Venezuela. Thanks to the Smartmatic machines, communists won the elections over and over again. Smartmatic is tied to Open Road Foundation and it used to have a subsidiary called Sequoia. Sequoia electronic voting machines are used in the US general election. Sequoia was eventually sold to Dominion Voting Systems. How do you like that people? The man in charge of counting your votes happens to have a favorite. This is exactly like Joseph famous quote: The people who cast the votes decide an election, the people who count the votes do. It matter that you go out and vote for Trump, what matters is that Soros is gonna count votes the way he wants to and just not right to have a private person in charge of the elections basically. Soros needs to have his entire fortune confiscated by the US government, nationalized and included in the state budget and have him locked up for the rest of his miserable life.

7982|Baba Vanga Was Right About Obama's Presidency And The 9/11 Attacks Sees Dire Future For Trump And The US|The Blind Prophetess claims Barrack Obama will be the last president of the United States. Baba Vagan is a cult figure in some circles in the Balkan states because of her uncanny knack for making astonishingly accurate predictions about the future. Baba Vagan, who is sometimes referred to as the blind prophetess, is credited with predicting the events of September 11th, 2001 in the 1980s. It has been said that she had a vision of being attacked by two steel birds which some believe could have symbolised the two hijacked jet planes which smashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre complex. Perhaps even more impressively, she also made a prediction that the 44th President of the United States would be an African-American. However, unfortunately for the controversial president-elect Donald Trump, Vagan has said that Barrack Obama would be the last president that America would ever have and that Trump will never actually come to power. Extrapolating from this, supporters of Vagan have suggested that something catastrophic will happen to American civilisation in the space of the next two months and that the ramifications will be so deep that it would irrevocably abolish the office of the presidency. Others have suggested that it means that Trump will eschew the title and role of and instead install himself as a permanent dictator of the United States . It has been estimated that 85% of Baba prophecies have come to pass. However, sceptics have suggested that her prophecies are so vague that she is credited with being accurate more often than is reasonable. Her supporters have also been criticised for making fraudulent claims about her powers of psychic deduction. However, for those who are inclined to find out more about the mysterious blind prophetess it may be of interest to know about some of her other predictions for the future. Vagan believes that human beings will have established cities under the oceans in 2130, that there will be a war on Mars in the year 3000 and by 3797 the Earth will be destroyed, but humanity will survive after fleeing to another universe.

799|Trump replays Clinton 'woman card,' defends 'pull out' Middle East strategy|Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday defended his criticism that Hillary campaign success is based largely on her being a female candidate and dismissed assertions about him having a soft foreign policy. The only card she has is the woman card, Trump told Fox News Sunday. Even women like her. If she were not a woman, she would not even be in this race. The billionaire businessman resumed his Clinton attack following his sweep in five Northeast primary contests, saying Tuesday that the only card she has is the woman's card. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote. The front-running Trump also dismissed criticism that he sounded like a liberal Democrat in his foreign policy speech last week by suggesting the United States scale back in the Middle East and focus on domestic spending. We need to knock off ISIS and get out of there, said Trump, who nevertheless continues to argue that overthrowing dictators has been a failed foreign policy strategy that has led to instability in the Middle East. Every move we've made in the Middle East has been wrong, he said, arguing other countries should pay more to protect the world and that more taxpayer money must go to U.S. infrastructure. We have this anymore, he said. We are spending all of our money in the Middle East. We need to strengthen our military and pull back In the meantime our country is becoming Third World. I will be tougher than Clinton. GOP primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told This Week that Trump's policy speech reflects a weak and naive approach to foreign policy. Trump also argued that his attacks on Clinton are no worse than those of her primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has questioned the former secretary of qualifications. While both Clinton and favorability ratings among women are low, are worse, especially among female general election voters. However, Trump argued Sunday that his numbers will improve if and when he faces Clinton in the general election. Once I start on Hillary, the numbers will change, he said.

80|NC Governor Partially Changes 'Bathroom Bill' after Backlash|"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has signed an executive order partially changing the state's new ""bathroom"" bill in an effort to quell a firestorm of criticism and economic backlash against his state. McCrory's order expands the equal employment policy for state employees to include sexual orientation and gender. He also reaffirmed private businesses' rights to establish their own bathroom policies, a provision already stated in the original bill. But the governor left intact perhaps the most contentious part of the law, which states that government bathrooms will be separated primarily by biological sex. ""We have long-held traditions of both ensuring equality for all our citizens and visitors while also respecting the privacy of everyone,"" McCrory said in a video message. ""We're also a state that strives to allow our people and businesses to be as independent as possible without overreaching goverment regulation."" Both state houses overwhelmingly passed House Bill 2, known as the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act. The law overrides the Charlotte ordinance giving people permission to use a public bathroom of their choice regardless of gender. On Tuesday, McCrory acknowledged outcry over the law, saying he'd listened to ""feedback"" from people for several weeks. He said that ""based upon this feedback, I am taking action to affirm and improve the state's commitment to privacy and equality."" McCrory signed the law March 23. Since then, several high profile businesses, including PayPal and Deutsche Bank, have cancelled expansion plans into the state. In an interview late last week, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest told CBN News the Left has used a ""methodically orchestrated campaign"" to fight the measure every step of the way. ""We didn't initiate the issue. It was started when a local city council passed an un-Constitutional ordinance opening all bathrooms and showers to all sexes at all times,"" Forest said. ""Once the state begins the process of fighting back, the Left first brings out the human rights groups to claim discrimination. This begins the narrative of intolerance,"" he explained. ""Then they take that intolerance narrative to a hand-picked group of CEOs and author a letter where they champion efforts to fight intolerance,"" he said. On Monday, hundreds of social conservatives gathered at the old Capitol building in Raleigh to call on McCrory to stand strong on the state's ""bathroom"" bill."|2022-10-07 06:00:00|REAL|Noah Khan|City Beat|116801|69336|286|4991|France|English|2022-09-10 20:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|1|True|3106800|824400|2443|4.766666666666667

8004|World Proud Of Its Calm, Measured Response To Trump Victory|0 Add Comment IN THE immediate aftermath of Donald shock win in the US presidential election, there were fears many people would become lost in grief, voicing their anger and sadness in all directions in a bid to vent their sense of profound fear and apprehension now that a person who has repeatedly uttered reprehensible beliefs occupies the most powerful position in the world. However, this proved not to be the case as WWN found out when it talked with numerous people in America and around the world, who exemplified the pride the human race now had in itself after being able to greet the horrific news in a calm and measured way. It is when faced with adversity, when hate shows it now owns the map, that we must forge a new path together to the brighter future we all want, but that future will be after a nuclear winter obviously, a sobbing wreck of a man and a proud American, Philip Henry shared with WWN, as he polished his shotgun and thought about taking a walk alone to his shed out back. The election clearly divided people, but it is time for the people to come together. Love trumps hate. A rising tide lifts all boats, New Yorker Sarah Klein shared as she boarded a small sail boat, unsure of where she was going, I have no idea how to sail but live like Kevin Costner in Waterworld if I have to, she added. Many people echoed the sentiments of Hillary concession speech in which the Democrat urged everyone to work with Donald Trump and give the man who called Mexicans rapists and murderers and called for a ban on Muslims the benefit of the doubt. Trump Tower look all that structurally sound, talking what? A few sticks of dynamite and the whole thing comes down. Just asking for a friend, obviously, shared another New Yorker we spoke to. It is believed the number of people placing their children in pods and launching them into space in the hope they reach a more tranquil planet with a brighter future elsewhere are still in the minority. The rational and reasoned response was also experienced outside of America where, although people acknowledged the fact heard every word uttered from the president elect, they suspect everything will be fine. Sure, what difference does it make, be grand sure, shared Dubliner Rebecca Kelly, fresh from pulling out all of her hair in a panic, and disconnecting her TV, radio and internet for at least four years.

8013|What is one more election thread, ehhh?|a reply to: kruphix Theocracy? Tim Kaine? In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Some of the people were wondering going on, who is this guy? Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview. He understood why. His mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly American faces. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was a time of such intrigue and suspicion, Mr. Kaine said. Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to Lord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread. Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching. But the strong social-justice message of liberation theology helped set Mr. Kaine on a left-veering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination, became a liberal mayor, and rose as a Spanish-speaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on Latin America.|2022-10-02 23:00:00|FAKE|Benjamin Singh|The Insight|252809|87964|84|8236|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-28 23:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2390400|2736000|2167|1.4

8017|API Reports A Build, DOE A Draw|API Reports A Build, DOE A Draw by IWB · October 26, 2016 Tweet You cannot make this could almost think an election was The markets were selling off and the VIX had just crossed into important bear territory when surprise! the DOE completely reversed the API report (which reported a larger than expected BUILD) and reported a DRAW. Now, I am prone to thinking that nearly all markets are in full shenanigan mode right now, I confess to that, but that comes from having a lot of context and possibly too much information. I knew that a major 400,000 barrel per day pipeline taking oil away from Cushing had broken a few days ago, so I surprised to hear of a build. Pipeline remains closed following oil spill in Oklahoma Updated: 3:50 PM CDT Oct 25, 2016 (AP) A Seaway Crude Pipeline Co. pipeline that spilled oil at a storage hub in Oklahoma remained closed Tuesday, according to a spokesman for Houston-based Enterprise Products Partners, a 50 percent owner of Seaway. As of right now we have an estimate of when it will be back up, as officials are trying to determine the cause of the spill that happened shortly before midnight Sunday in Cushing, spokesman Rick Rainey said. CUSHING, Oklahoma While crews in Cushing continue to clean up oil after a pipeline break early Monday morning, the spill is stoking fears about what may be to come for the oil hub. The Seaway Pipeline is one of the largest in the nation, running 500 miles from Cushing to refineries in Freeport, Texas. Because two pipelines, the owning company Enterprise could shut down one and keep oil flowing, but only 450,000 barrels per day. The section of pipe that burst can carry 50,000 barrels of oil or roughly 2.75 million gallons. So right on top of the reported build and right on top of a major break in one of the largest oil pipelines carrying crude AWAY from Cushing, a market manipulating government lackey to do? Why report a surprise DRAW, thereby spiking oil, and indeed the entire US equity markets because, such as. This all feels about as believable as anything else this (s)election cycle.

8018|Megyn Kelly Finally Reveals The Details Of Ailes’ Sexual Harrassment|Comments FOX News star Megyn Kelly has finally revealed the disturbing details of the abuse and harrassment she endured at the right-wing propaganda factory. Serial sexual predator and fascist ideologue Roger Ailes lost his job as the CEO of FOX News a few months ago after anchor Gretchen Carlson publicly accused her old boss of sexually harassing her and using his position to try to extort sexual favors from her. As the male stars of the network rushed to defend Ailes and over a dozen women came forward to share their own stories, Kelly stayed silent for a time. Now, adding material to her upcoming memoir detailing how Ailes harassed her and threatened her job : Roger began pushing the limits. There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with between obviously inappropriate sexually charged comments (e.g. about the sexy I must have and how like to see me in them) and legitimate professional advice. Kelly also claims Ailes offered to promote her through the ranks in exchange for sexual favors. At one point, she writes, he crossed a new to grab me repeatedly and kiss me on the lips. Upon her rebuffing his advances, she recalls, he asked me an ominous question: is your contract And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me. After Ailes was fired (with a $40 million severance package!), he almost immediately joined the presidential campaign of fellow serial sexual predator Donald Trump. The fall of Ailes and the backlash surrounding Donald hot mic audio comments in which he admits to sexual assault have brought the issue of sexual harassment and the ways in which powerful white men abuse women in the workplace into the forefront of the public eye. Men like Ailes and Trump have gotten away with their crimes for far too long; women have been forced to suffer in silence, forced to choose between their dignity and agency over their own bodies or their careers and financial well-being a choice nobody should have to make. The more women that come forward to tell their stories, the more will follow and hopefully we can someday geld the toxic patriarchy which silences women and allows predators to roam free.|2022-10-02 20:00:00|FAKE|Alexander Lee|The Herald Tribune|825262|4190|173|9444|Nigeria|English|2022-10-01 13:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|2613600|2725200|2264|2.8833333333333333

The mannequin challenge, the latest craze sweeping through social media platforms at the minute, involves groups of people posing stock-still as a camera roves around them, with everyone from the Portuguese football team to Michelle Obama to a group of lads at a house party in Stillorgan taking part. All those videos pale in comparison, however, to the epic one-take shot filmed in the war-torn region of Aleppo in which 976 men, women, children and babies are shown staying perfectly still, with poses ranging from half-buried underneath a collapsed hospital to clutching throat as the lungs fill with chlorine gas.

Please scroll down for video This remarkable photo is the last thing lost satellite, Hitomi, captured. Black holes with their ability to consume an entire galaxy, are perhaps the most feared object in the heavens due to the voracious appetite which they hold. It has now been discovered that black holes also have the ability to also feed the growth of galaxies. Black holes effectively affect and control the growth and expansion of galaxies, acting as a kind of regulator. It appears from recent discoveries that the universe has a life and death cycle for its heavenly bodies. Black holes appear to be at the center of this life cycle, a kind of grim reaper and giver of life all rapped up into one clever little package. The discovery of this process was noted by a Japanese satellite shortly before its unfortunate demise. The satellite had been focused on the Perseus Cluster which has at its center a super massive black hole. Data from the satellite demonstrated that black holes provide energy for the growth of galaxies. Remember that energy is never lost but instead changed and transformed as time moves on so it makes sense that black holes both absorb and expel energy. Energy is transformed and never destroyed, not even by black holes . Black holes are formed when a star of enormous magnitude ultimately burns out, and the core collapses into a black hole. The process of a star dying out is a kin to what happens when a nuclear reactor melts down which is both an awesome and terrifying event. Once formed, the black hole absorbs anything which winds up in its path, which includes entire galaxies. The magnitude of such destruction of mass is overwhelming and difficult for the human mind process. This article Lost Black Hole Satellite Took This LAST Photo.

The counter-espionage department of the ministry has reported that those arrested have already given confessions and evidence of the circumstances of the committing of such a terroristic and extremist crime. The neo-Nazis had maintained contact with employees of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and operated on the territory of the DPR in its interests. It has been established that all terrorist and subversive actions in the DPR and LPR are carried out by the SBU in the framework of an approved operational plan, the purpose of which is to intensify internal contradictions between the leaders of the Donbass republics, creating the preconditions and circumstances for confrontation between them, the Ministry of State Security emphasized, adding that the detainees are being further investigated.

8039|News: Election Night Disaster: John King Tapped His Electoral College Map Too Hard And Fell Headfirst Into A Digital Hellscape|Email With millions of eyes watching CNN for election results tonight, the network really afford any high-profile screwups. But unfortunately, exactly what they got when John King tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape. Ouch. some major egg on face! The night appeared to be going smoothly in the Washington studio, until King tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial Ohio swing districts. When the map seemed to freeze up, a frustrated King tapped the Magic Wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen. Before Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper could step in, he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful, swirling data. With millions of Americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election, CNN has been forced to press on even as they try to free John King from the computerized map. A noticeably emotional Wolf Blitzer mouthed the words sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely Oregon voters, the bar graph of which animated right into John spine, launching nearly all the way to the mid-Atlantic states. If CNN producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging King to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen, it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were. When Connecticut was called for Hillary Clinton, the trapped John King was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive. This level of panic was matched moments later when King tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer, only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured. Yikes. CNN will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong, and on their biggest night, too. With plenty of states left to declare tonight, still time for King to be rescued from the computerized nightmare. But with uploading a JPEG of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return King to the studio, CNN may be running out of options. No matter how this shakes out, clear CNN has a MAJOR technology fail on their hands. Then again, this is just what happens when anchors play with tech toys without reading the instructions. Well, better luck in 2020, guys.|2022-09-19 11:00:00|FAKE|Maxwell Rivera|Voice of the Nation|609009|7268|69|6670|Argentina|English|2022-09-07 20:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|565200|1569600|2436|1.15

Betcha know they were the epitome of evil of white privilege, genocide, and a whole host more of crimes against social justice. So saieth Misao Dean, professor of English at the University of Victoria in Canada, who shared her views on CBC Radio , which reveals in its intro that Dean wrote the book on the evils of canoe appropriation. Its title is Inheriting a Canoe Paddle: The Canoe in Discourses of English-Canadian Nationalism. You can listen to the interview here , or if you have something more important to do (what could be more important?), be advised that Heat Street provides portions of the enlightening Q & A. For example, when asked whether we should look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or as a symbol of colonialism, Dean responds: Absolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people. If you prefer the dissenting view, scroll down to the comments section of the CBC Radio page, where reader Patrick Saunders opines, Academia has become a sit-com. A not really funny, sad-in-a-car-crash-sorta-way sit-com. Then this from Kawartha Cottager: As soon as the ice is out of the lake I am going to head to the cottage and burn down my boat house so myself and my family will no longer be tortured by those symbols of colonialism like my canoes, kayaks and worst of all my Laser sailboat, that other symbol of colonialism. Those Euros arrived on sailboats back in the 15th century after all.

Children in school in Germany are being taught to chant Islamic prayers, including the phrase Allah Akbar, which is used before Radical Islamists commit terrorist attacks. The father of a girl at a school in Garmisch-Partekirchen, Germany, discovered his daughter was forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he found a handout she was given, The Express is reporting . He said his daughter was forced by teachers to memorize the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to a news organization in Australia. The handout read: Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you. It had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the Bavarian school. Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their nursery was refusing to acknowledge Christmas rituals to accommodate the diverse cultures of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils were Christian. A spokesman for Kassel explained: There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.

Gerrard is believed to have used Café de Ketel, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, as a front for international drug trafficking. NCA regional head of investigations Greg McKenna said: Robert Gerrard handing himself in shows the impact we are having with our Most Wanted campaigns. Three arrests in under a week is a tremendous result. We know at this stage how long Gerrard has been back in the UK for, but he told our officers that the pressure of being on the run had got too much for him . The fugitives on our Most Wanted list really do have nowhere to hide. I would urge any of the remaining ones to take note save yourself the trouble and hand yourself in because we will never stop hunting you and you will face justice, he added. Crimestoppers director of operations Roger Critchell said: The fact Robert Gerrard handed himself in to police is again an indication that when the pressure mounts, hiding places become harder to find. This is a great result as it follows two fugitive arrests in the last week from our sister campaign targeting those on the run in Spain. These campaigns really do work . His next hearing will be at Manchester Court on November 23. Via RT .

And no lamer duck than a president whose just days away from being replaced. Perhaps the perfect opportunity for really happening while looking: A massive spike illegal immigrants streaming through the southern border mainly in the border town of McAllen, Texas. coming on a daily basis and being trucked to a migrant center at a Catholic Church. fitted with ankle monitors and told to sit. Sit and wait while they file for asylum. Apparently, the illegals are being told that Hillary Clinton will win the election and that when she does, she will grant amnesty to illegals who are already here by the time elected. So flooding in for that reason. On the other hand, some illegals are being told that Donald Trump will win, build a massive border wall and once up, nobody will ever get in again. So flooding in for that reason as well. Some days, CBS Local reports , the McAllen stretch of the border sees 1,000 illegal crossers per day. getting mass spikes of people crossing and turning themselves in, he said. Experts told CBS News the number of immigrants crossing the border drop after Election Day. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly said as president the U.S. will build a wall along the Mexico border to keep out immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. Earlier this month, Trump claimed the U.S. government is speeding up the citizenship process for immigrants on the waiting list so they can vote. letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote, Trump said during a meeting with the National Border Patrol Council. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to propose immigration legislation in her first 100 days as president that would include a route to citizenship. Her approach is largely in line with that approved by Democrats and Republicans in the Senate in 2013 but turned aside by the House. Trump has said that he opposes any pathway to legal status for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. They would have to return to their home countries and apply for legal entry should they wish to come back. He has not said what would happen to those who choose to stay, but said they are subject to deportation. Trump has also called for an end to birthright citizenship, currently granted to anyone born in the U.S. as per the 14 th Amendment.|2022-10-02 22:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|Evening Echo|63332|33142|290|8007|Spain|English|2022-09-09 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|680400|2732400|2408|4.833333333333333
8053|Putin “Collecting” Former US Allies|How Plan to Collect Former US Allies Could End the American Empire Oct 24, 2016 ( UR ) As Anti-Media reported Monday, analysis of recent events suggests President Vladimir Putin may have ulterior motives in sending the largest Russian naval fleet since the Cold War steaming toward the Mediterranean Sea. He may, in fact, be initiating the first stages of militarily securing the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline. As highlighted , positioning the aircraft carrier-led fleet just off the western coast of Syria in the Mediterranean also strategically places it between friendly nations to the north and south Turkey, with whom the pipeline deal was officially signed last week, and Egypt, with whom Russia is now expanding ties both militarily and economically. But in truth, the agreements being struck around the Mediterranean while unquestionably important in their own right are indicative of a much broader, and rather recent, Russian pattern. On the southeast border of Russian ally, Iran, for instance, lies Pakistan. Russia raised eyebrows back in September when it announced that for the first time in modern history Russia and Pakistan would conduct joint military drills a signal influence is spreading across Asia. In October, it was reported additional joint exercises between the two nations had been scheduled for 2017. neighbor to the east is India. In mid-October, it was announced largely state-owned oil company Rosneft, along with other partners, would invest around $12.9 billion in Essar Oil. Additionally, a Russian state investment fund would work with an Indian counterpart to invest $1 billion toward Indian infrastructure.

Aviv Khavich published his final column for The Daily Targum Sunday night, arguing that immigration enforcement is not anti-immigrant. He spoke as an immigrant himself, born in Israel after his Ashkenazi Jewish parents fled Belarus in the wake of the Soviet collapse. But the trigger for the firing may have been demand that his column include the phrase illegal aliens to describe those in the country illegally. It was the final straw for the editor, who said Khavich repeatedly fought over stylistic editing changes to his columns over the past several months. {snip} But two of his last three [columns] were about immigration. Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: Justice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us. Khavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that every instance of I wrote was changed to by his editors. But I considered it a part of my opinion to not use the latter term, which he finds politically correct and also inaccurate. When Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the illegal edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. The AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using illegal to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed illegal immigrant just a year earlier . But AP Style also frowns upon term used in published the term is not precise. Khavich notes that federal law uses the term alien. His editor was not happy after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day. {snip} At the slightest questioning of their they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative, he wrote in The Tab.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took the stage in Orlando at Calle Orange, a Puerto Rican-themed festival, on Sunday when some in the crowd started booing, NPR reported . The jeering got louder as the Cuban-American senator, seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year, was introduced. And when the emcee asked for applause as Rubio took the same, boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd, NPR added. Thank you for having me today, Rubio said in Spanish.

In a Wall Street Journal column this morning, James Freeman, an editorial page editor, notes that getting candidates in races below Donald Trump on the Republican ticket to denounce him has become a regular sport in the media. But he wonders why reporters force down-ballot Democrats to take a position on each new Clinton email revelation. That would be fine. Although there is nothing we suspect, thanks to WikiLeaks, we have more details than ever about Clinton venality and political corruption. But there is a line of questioning that is even more important. Why other candidates on the Democrat ticket be asked to endorse or disavow regime change wars in Libya and Syria? they be made to own the jihadist-generating carnage she champions? it be wise to tie political supporters to her war trajectory with Russia as well, so that if she has her way the survivors will know who was to blame? 1:20 pm on October 28, 2016|2022-10-01 02:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Sunrise Chronicle|293924|75847|138|6776|France|English|2022-09-08 20:00:00|Reseña|0|True|2574000|651600|1065|2.3

And has that person been drawn and quartered?"" Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 27, 2016 The Backstory: Clinton surrogate Neera Tanden was going on CNN with Jake Tapper in July of 2015, where she was told she'd be shown a new poll comparing Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders and others, including Jeb Bush. While she didn't know the results of said poll, she told John Podesta (via email) that she expected it to be rough. Podesta fired back: PS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee? To which Tanden replied: ""Well, let's see what the poll actually says. Let's hope the Democratic party is not suicidal."" Then Tanden dropped the hammer: ""Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered? Like whole thing is fucking insane."" WikiLeaks has thus far released 33,000 Podesta emails. While the Clinton campaign has yet to confirm their accuracy, they have also not challenged their authenticity. It's been 3 weeks since @WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta emails. Not one doc has been claimed - let alone demonstrated - to be doctored. Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2016 Expect even more to come out over the next two weeks, but keep this in mind: Way back in 2015, the people at the top of the Clinton campaign were at war over the decision to let her use personal emails.

Shortly after the first presidential debate, Cheney told Fox Bret Baier that the real estate assertions regarding the September 11 that George W. Bush willingly let them way off base. He clearly understand or has not spent any time learning about the facts of that period, Cheney said. a little curious that Cheney has decided to board the Trump Train. also a break from the rest of Bush World, as representatives for George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush say neither former president will back the presidential bid.

The GOP presidential nominee had just $16 million left in his campaign coffers on Oct. 19, compared to Hillary $62 million. When the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, war chest grew to $153 million, while totaled $68 million. total fundraising dropped 39% in the first 19 days of October. $29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. At a time when Trump needs boots on the ground to get out the Republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of $2 million. There going to be a last-minute ad blitz for Trump, or a reservation of television time so that the Republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. The plan for Trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. Trump promised to donate $100 million to his campaign but has only given $56 million . The billionaire who promised to self-finance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. Trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in October. Fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. The money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. Hillary Clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. cash crush points to a depressed base that expect him to win.

A Houthi rebel man holds a US-made cluster bomb fragment after a Saudi-led airstrike in capital, Monday, April 20, 2015. (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed) After a solid 19 months of endorsing the Saudi war in Yemen, selling the Saudis massive amounts of arms, and refueling Saudi bombers over airspace, the Obama Administration today called on the Saudis to halt airstrikes against Yemen, and accept that there is no military solution. A top Human Rights Watch director noted that the call carried a lot more weight if the US providing the bombs the Saudis are dropping on Yemen in the first place, though former US officials say its almost certain this include any dial back in US arms sales. The call likely reflects the peace plan being presented to both sides and immediately rejected by the pro-Saudi officials. Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. At the same time, the US opposition to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi right to self-defense, which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. The US has insisted Saudi aid is under review since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out."|2022-09-24 17:00:00|FAKE|Emily Parker|The Pulse|928928|44025|186|7067|Russia|English|2022-09-11 05:00:00|Noticia internacional|0|True|856800|2023200|1784|3.1

Bernie Sanders on Thursday attributed the Republican win to the failure of the liberal elite to represent working people. It is an embarrassment, I think, to the entire of [the] Democratic Party that millions of white working-class people decided to vote for Mr. Trump, which suggests that the Democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country, the progressive senator and one-time presidential candidate told the Associated Press . You cannot be a party which on one hand says in favor of working people, in favor of the needs of young people but we quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class, he continued. People do not believe that. got to decide which side on. according to hypothetical polls conducted during the primary, would have posed a more formidable challenge to Trump than Democratic nominee Hillary the news outlet that he is not ruling out another presidential bid in 2020. But, the 75-year-old senator from Vermont said that, for now, he is focused on rebuilding the party. Among the potential changes to be made, Sanders told AP that he would recommend Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a position that Ellison has been reportedly vying for. The interview comes one day after Sanders issued a statement saying he is prepared to work with the president-elect [t]o the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country. But, the senator indicated on Thursday he did not think that would be likely. I hope wrong, but I believe that he is a fraud, and I think despite all of his rhetoric about being a champion of the working class, it will turn out to be hollow, Sanders said.

Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead. A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead. A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack. More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology. Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload. A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.

8109|Police: Oklahoma Double Murder Suspect Has Hit List, May Be Headed to Nevada|Yahoo News A 38-year-old Oklahoma man who has evaded police for two days after killing two people and shooting four others including two police officers has a hit list and may intend to kill up to eight more people, authorities said Tuesday. This is a man who has indicated a total propensity to kill people, to injure people, shoot people, said Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel. He has no care for human life whatsoever. Authorities believe he may be headed to Nevada and have notified police there to be on the lookout. Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel told ABC News that the suspect, Michael Vance, could face the death penalty if convicted of the crimes. Whetsel is warning citizens to stay clear if they spot Vance, adding that he has absolutely nothing to lose. rampage began Sunday evening, when he allegedly shot two police officers responding to the scene at a mobile home park over reports of shots fired in the area. The two officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries, officials say, and were temporarily disabled as Vance fled the scene in their patrol car. One officer was shot in the foot and another was hit by gunfire in both legs. Investigators believe Vance live-streamed two videos while on the run, one from inside the police cruiser and another while inside another vehicle. In one of the videos, Vance appears in a blood-covered shirt and says been shot before showing a rifle on the seat next to him. Letting know, look, this is real, he says in the video, according to the Associated Press. If you want to know up next, stay tuned to your local news. Vance said things were going to be intense, according to an affidavit released on Monday night. He then proceeded to a mobile home park, where police discovered the bodies of two of his relatives. Officials identified those victims as 55-year-old Ronald Everett Wilkson and 54-year-old Valerie Kay Wilkson, his wife. The affidavit describes wounds consistent with attempts to sever one head and the arm. Vance then allegedly shot at and injured a woman as he was in the process of stealing her silver 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse . Vance is also suspected of shooting a man during an attempted carjacking early Monday. Vance was last known to be driving a 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse and was armed with an AK-47. He is considered to be armed and extremely dangerous, authorities say. Sheriff Whetsel instructed any potential witnesses not to approach Vance but to call 911 and let the police handle the situation.|2022-10-10 08:00:00|FAKE|Caleb Shah|Frontline Times|83741|52126|99|2087|Italy|English|2022-10-03 04:00:00|Columna|1|True|3373200|2754000|2493|1.65

The minute a flat goes up on Daft, we mail the landlord and put on a bit of a show for them, letting them know more where that came from, said Wilson, undressing quickly in a bid to secure a bedsit above a shop which just got listed at a month. If you think going to just show up and get the place, forget it. like trying to get bread in Russia in the 80s.

8124|Crack in Earth’s magnetic shield detected|Crack in magnetic shield detected 11/04/2016 DNA INDIA The largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor, located in India, has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the magnetic shield, according to scientists. The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck Earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm. The GRAPES-3 muon telescope located at Tata Institute of Fundamental Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty in Tamil Nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about 20 GeV last year lasting for two hours. The burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona, and moving with a speed of about 2.5 million kilometres per hour struck our planet, causing a severe compression of magnetosphere from 11 to 4 times the radius of Earth. It triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries, according to the study published in the journal Physical Review Letters this week. magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres, which acts as the first line of defence, shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays, thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations. Numerical simulations performed by the GRAPES-3 researchers, including Pravata K Mohanty, indicate that the magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere. magnetic field bent these particles about 180 degree, from the day-side to the night-side of the Earth where it was detected as a burst by the GRAPES-3 muon telescope around mid-night on 22 June 2015. The data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the 1280-core computing farm that was built in-house by the GRAPES-3 team of physicists and engineers at the Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty. Solar storms can cause major disruption to human civilisation by crippling large electrical power grids, global positioning systems (GPS), satellite operations and communications.|2022-09-09 21:00:00|FAKE|Logan Wong|The Pulse|871956|81984|371|6352|Kenya|English|2022-09-09 18:00:00|Noticia local|0|True|741600|730800|2257|6.183333333333334

Patty Sanchez has gone from 320 kilograms to 215 kilograms after years of constant eating with the encouragement of her ex-boyfriend and online fat fetishists. Having purposefully consumed up to 13,000 calories per day for years on end, it is a minor miracle in itself that Patty has made it to 51 and is in position to change her lifestyle. After splitting from her boyfriend of ten years, Patty soon realized that she had become very isolated and vulnerable due to her size. The mother-of-four has spoken out about the positive effect weight loss has had on both her personal and family life, also allowing her to undertake a wide range of everyday tasks previously impossible to her. ""I was tremendous and I was dying a slow death.I realized that the feeding relationship I was in and the squashing was benefiting others, but it for me. The weight loss had a lot to do with my break up with my ex I was being served every meal daily, and when we broke up I had to take care of myself.I never feared death before it was something I never thought about when I was getting bigger and bigger. But when I reached my lowest and walk to the bathroom without getting winded I was worried I be there for my kids and grand kids. My struggles fully surface until I was single and had no one to help me and cook, bathe, or leave the house it was very lonely, she said in an interview. Today, with the help of her sons, Patty eats 3,000 calories a day and is more mobile. She said: I stay away from fast food and eat more vegetables, fruits and poultry. Now I can do things that people take for granted that I do - like walk, bathe, and paint my toenails which I couldn't reach for years."" My children are very proud of me for changing my life around - we have a better relationship now,"" she added.

Duehren et al., Harvard Crimson, November 3, 2016 Harvard has cancelled the soccer season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the season because the practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016. As a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 soccer season, Scalise wrote. The team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year. Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 soccer team created a scouting report of that soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, team of lawyers, to review the matter. {snip} The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects view that both the behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community, Faust wrote in a statement.

The family farm which was owned by Tom father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. My dad and Bill step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer. My father was a strong Democratic party supporter all his life and a big Bill Clinton fan, so I never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away Sex, drugs and cattle During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. The Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, when everything went wrong he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. I know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, not something wish my worst enemy to live to see he told local reporters. sorry for the Clinton family, but as a God-fearing Christian, I just had to let the truth be known he adds.

8186|One Photo Sums Up How Differently America Treats People Of Color And The White Bundy Militiamen|Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr Two stunningly depressing things happened in America on Thursday evening that demonstrate just how differently the country treats its citizens based on race and they happened more or less at the same time. In North Dakota, police driving armored vehicles (yes, like tanks) and armed with rifles, sound cannons, and shotguns loaded with nonlethal beanbags marched in formation to shut down peaceful protesters opposing an oil pipeline. A few states over in Oregon, a jury found that the violent militia group which led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife reserve was innocent of all charges and free to go . America is two countries with two different sets of rules, and Thursday evening highlighted that fact in stunning detail. On Twitter, user @theshrillest put the juxtaposition in all its glory in a single screengrab. His twitter feed was a mixture of stories about the violent suppression of a peaceful protest led by a Native American tribe directly affected by the environmental impact of the oil pipeline and news of the release of the Bundy militia a group of out-of-state rabblerousers who believe the federal government should be disbanded. (@theshrillest) October 27, 2016 This is the second time the Bundy family threatened to kill federal agents and expressed a desire to lead a revolution only to see zero charges stick to them. The group will now get to return to Nevada, just in time for an election in which many conservatives are openly stating that they plan on taking up arms if Trump loses. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in? Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 In short, a scary time to be a democracy.

8199|New RNC Ad Campaign Reminds Voters Obamacare Was Originally 'Hillarycare'|"Share on Twitter The Republican National Committee launched a new video advertisement Thursday hitting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on her support for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The 27-second video, which is part of a five-figure campaign on Facebook, details the recent developments surrounding increased healthcare premiums for individuals in certain states by reminding voters of Clinton's support for the landmark law. The video, obtained by Independent Journal Review, also plays Clinton's quote taking credit for the Affordable Care Act's framework: Before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. In a statement, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said, Hillary tone deaf promises to expand Obamacare will only mean a greater strain on the finances of many American families, adding: Hillary Clinton has for years touted her own botched healthcare plans as the blueprint for this trainwreck of a law that was designed to fail, and the almost daily reports of skyrocketing premiums, disappearing options, and collapsing state exchanges will remain a reality if she is president. Obamacare's struggles have been a prominent focus for Republicans in many down-ballot races across the United States. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has touched on the issue as well, releasing a brief healthcare position paper . Because of Clinton's role in the framework and selling of the Affordable Care Act, Priebus said that voters should reject Clinton.

8206|Just When You Thought It Was Safe To Swim, Scientists Discovered A Two-Headed Shark|posted by Eddie For the first time, scientists have observed a two-headed shark growing in an egg. This catshark ( Galeus atlanticus ) lives only in the western Mediterranean, at depths of 330 to 710 meters (1,082 to 2,329 feet), and is considered near threatened. Workers on a research vessel collected the embryonic fish as part of an expedition that retrieved 797 embryos from the western Mediterranean sea. It had two brains, four eyes, two mouths, twenty gills (double the usual ten), and two notochords a developmental precursor of the spine. The two heads fused at the neck. Inside, it had two hearts, and a doubled digestive system that fused together where two stomachs met at a single intestine. When an animal has two heads it is said to exhibit dicephaly. The condition is relatively rare in the animal kingdom but has been seen in many different groups, from snakes to dolphins to people. You can see the shark in this figure, drawn from a paper in the Journal of Fish Biology where the researchers describe their discovery. Figures (d) and (e) depict another shark embryo with a single head. Two-headedness is believed to happen in all animals with spines. But rare enough that never been spotted in an egg-laying shark before. As recently as 1992 , some researchers believed that the uncommon body structure was the result of twins incompletely merging together. But now widely accepted that the cause is actually an incomplete separation of one embryo into two. No one has yet offered a conclusive explanation for what causes this to happen. The two-headed shark embryo described in this paper would probably not have survived had it developed though it get the chance to try. When the researchers spotted the doubled shark through the translucent walls of its egg, they split the egg open and preserved the embryo for study. Read the original article on Tech Insider .

We were told we had to bomb and kill Gaddafi in Libya because his regime made us less safe. Ditto with the Taliban in Afghanistan and Assad in Syria. Now. 15 years after 9/11, Americans are seeing through the endless wars that have lasted through the Bush and Obama Administrations. Trillions spent, untold thousands killed, societies destroyed, people displaced. A new poll sponsored by the Center for the National Interest and the Charles Koch Institute has found that Americans feel less, not more safe after a decade and a half of war.

8211|The ‘Two-Party Racket’ Is Incapable of Dealing With Our Present Crises|The Is Incapable of Dealing With Our Present Crises Ian Sane / (CC-BY-2.0) Indications that Clinton is heading towards a solid win might suggest that 2016 is the safest year ever to vote Green, right? No, say Democrats. Dems will never admit a good time to go Green, writes Scott McLarty, media coordinator for the Green Party, at The Hill. They want a field permanently limited to two parties of war and Wall Street. To understand what lost under the two-party racket, compare the cringeworthy Clinton-Trump debates with Green nominee Jill rebuttals. Stein addressed issues that were either touched on superficially or absent from the bipartisan bicker-fest. She proposed solutions especially the Green New Deal. Progressive ideas, the kind advanced by Bernie Sanders in his call for political revolution, are effectively censored in the debates. Marginalization of alt-parties in the late 20th century is one of the unmentioned reasons for the triumph of the right wing in both major parties. It explains the disappearance of big progressive ideas like New Deal and Great Society. The Green New Deal is a vision of how we can improve the lives of millions of people and rescue the planet from climate chaos. Democrats give us no such vision. All offered is modest reforms, ideas that pretended to be progressive but (e.g., Obamacare, originally Romneycare), and slogans like Change We Can Believe In. The vision Hillary Clinton evokes is not Trump. The two-party racket is incapable of dealing with the crises of the 21st century: climate change; creeping corporate oligarchy and economic inequality; the national-security/mass-incarceration state; endless war. These crises promise an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown. The danger they pose can be compared with the rise of totalitarian states and the Cold nuclear menace during the 20th century.|2022-10-04 17:00:00|FAKE|Isabella Nguyen|Frontline Times|382746|70430|256|8211|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-23 01:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|1879200|2887200|1948|4.266666666666667

8244|House Republicans Plan Secret Meeting To Discuss Overthrowing Paul Ryan|By Jason Easley on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 9:38 pm The more things change, the more they stay the same. The House Freedom Caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical Republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting Paul Ryan and demanding more ransom from GOP leadership. Share on Twitter Print This Post The more things change, the more they stay the same. The House Freedom Caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical Republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting Paul Ryan and demanding more ransom from GOP leadership. Politico reported , One of the most pressing questions preoccupying Washington is what the group will do about Paul Ryan. The Wisconsin Republican has said he intends to seek another term as House speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen Republican lawmakers that drove John Boehner out of the Speakership last year. The Freedom Caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members, some at the expense of GOP authority. There have been early rumblings that Speaker Ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with Hillary Clinton if she wins the election. One of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right Republicans to cause trouble. If Republican majority shrinks, he will be an even bigger hostage to the far-right wing of his caucus. The dysfunctional dynamic in the House is going to continue even if Hillary Clinton wins the election. Ryan has run into the same hurdles that John Boehner faced. House Republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything. The fact that the Freedom Caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change. If Paul Ryan cave to their demands, they will force Ryan out of the Speaker position. A group of House Republicans is plotting new ways to keep the House from working properly before a new president has even been elected. This is a reminder that Washington is fine. the Republican Party broken.|2022-10-09 08:00:00|FAKE|Xavier Chang|Frontline Times|859602|92110|259|6515|Nigeria|English|2022-09-10 04:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|3286800|766800|2046|4.316666666666666
8248|BUSTED: Eric Trump Admits Daddy ‘Started The Conversation’ About Obama’s Birth Certificate (AUDIO)|BUSTED: Eric Trump Admits Daddy The About Birth Certificate (AUDIO) By Andrew Bradford on October 28, 2016 Subscribe Donald Trump has tried to deny that he is the person most responsible for keeping alive claims that President Obama born in the United States and is therefore not eligible to serve as President. The GOP nominee has been the chief proponent of what is now known as birtherism. And yet when asked about the matter, Trump tries to shift the blame to Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff in the 2008 Democratic race. Now, however, we have proof that Trump was indeed the driving force of birtherism, and that proof comes from the mouth of his son, Eric. NBC news found audio of Eric Trump talking to biographer Michael author of The Truth About Trump . In that audio, the Trump son admits: I think with the birthers well, then, just prove it. Meaning these people are going out saying that which a lot of people were at the time. just show us. Just be transparent. the leader of the free world, be There are underlying themes to this, and in fact, he has done his best to start the conversation that was unwilling to be had before. Now that conversation might flush itself out in one of several different ways. But at least the conversation is being had. Yes, at least we are trying to question the nationality of the first African-American President in the history of the United States. Nothing nefarious or the least bit racist about that, is there? Bullshit! Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he repeatedly called for President Obama to release his birth certificate, and he did so to garner media attention as he considered running for the GOP nomination years before he finally did. Donald Trump is a lying weasel and racist asshat who needs to be defeated soundly on November 8. He and his hateful ideas must be resoundingly rejected by the American people, who deserve better than the division he offers.

825|Done Deal? Clinton, Trump Shift to General Election after Big Wins|"The front-runners in the race for president are one step closer to clinching their parties' nomination. Donald Trump completed a five-state sweep in Tuesday's Republican presidential primaries, while Hillary Clinton won four out of the five states, losing only Rhode Island to her rival Bernie Sanders. Now the two front-runners are beginning to shift their focus, with each expecting to go up against the other in the General Election. ""Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she would get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she has got going is the woman's card,"" Trump told supporters. Clinton fired back, saying, ""Well, if fighting for women's healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the 'woman's card,' then deal me in!"" The former secretary of state now has nearly 90 percent of the delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination, and after a sweep of Tuesday's primaries, Trump is one step closer to avoiding a contested convention. Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are hoping their alliance to stay out of each other's way in Indiana, Oregon, and New Mexico will help slow down Trump's momentum and block him from winning the nomination before the convention. ""I got good news for you tonight. This campaign moves back to more favorable terrain,"" Cruz told his supporters. Currently, Trump has 950 delegates, Cruz has 560, and Kasich has 153. It takes 1,237 to win the nomination. Meanwhile on the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders refuses to go quietly into the night. ""The fight we are waging is not an easy fight, but I know you are prepared to wage that fight,"" the Vermont lawmaker told supporters. The candidates now move on to Indiana, with Sanders, Cruz, and Trump all holding events there Wednesday. With Kasich pulling back in the Hoosier State, Cruz will basically have a shot at a one-on-one race against Trump. But if he loses, it could turn out to be his last stand."|2022-10-08 09:00:00|REAL|Xavier Chang|Evening Echo|365437|99037|401|7888|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-12 18:00:00|Editorial|1|True|990000|3204000|1961|6.683333333333334

Muslims trying to claim that the Hebrew-language Dead Sea Scrolls are Arab Muslim in origin So, let me get this straight. The Dead Sea Scrolls are demonstrably written in Hebrew. But the Palestinians are now saying these ancient documents are, like Temple Mount , the holiest site in Judaism, Arab Muslim in origin.That is how ridiculous the campaign to delegitimize Israel has become. Israel Today Carmel Shama-Hacohen ambassador to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) said the Palestinians raised the matter informally during a recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin. JERUSALEM POST The dead Sea Scrolls are about 900 documents and Biblical texts, discovered in one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century in the and in caves in and around Qumran on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea. The texts include some of the only known surviving copies of Biblical documents made before 100 B.C.E., and preserve evidence of Jewish life during the Second Temple period. According to the ambassador and to representatives of the Israel Antiquities Authority who were present at the meeting, the Palestinians intend to make a formal claim to the Dead Sea Scrolls when the committee next convenes in 2017. This is another provocative and audacious attempt by the Palestinians to rewrite history and to erase our connection to our land, Shama-Hacohen told The Jerusalem Post . The Dead Sea Scrolls are factual and weighty archeological evidence of the presence of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel. [The accusation is] part of an ongoing effort to deny the continuous Jewish presence in Israel. The Dead Sea Scrolls provide incontrovertible proof of the historical facts that underpin the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state, David Koschitzky, chairman of the UJA Federation in Toronto. As such, they pose a threat to the ongoing attempts to obscure the unique relationship of the Jewish people with the land of Israel.|2022-10-01 01:00:00|FAKE|Isabella Nguyen|The Informer|275723|33630|48|8145|Ukraine|English|2022-09-09 12:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2570400|709200|2099|0.8

Hillary campaign adviser Robbie Mook released the following statement: seen polls tighten since the last debate, and we expect things to get even closer by election day, he said. Donald Trump could win this election, Mook added. Just recently, the Clinton campaign was confident of a massive victory and was looking to run up the tally.

Today Investors Intelligence issued an important note about gold, silver and the mining stocks: The Precious Metals Bullish % rallied 4.55% on Wednesday, reversing the P&F chart direction back to the upside for the first time since September. IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored Investors Intelligence continues: The chart has pulled out of oversold and has a new status of Bull-alert. Investors should be looking to buy upside reassertion candidates (see chart below). The PHLX Gold & Silver Index develops a bullish P&F breakout signal at 89 with a price objective of 102 and a stop loss at 83 (see chart below). King World News note: Despite the post-Fed meeting intervention to suppress the gold, silver and mining share markets, when Investors Intelligence states, Investors should be looking to buy upside reassertion candidates, what they mean is that investors should be purchasing high-quality investments in the gold and silver sector. This includes top-tier mining stocks and associated gold and silver ETFs. Although the Philadelphia Gold & Silver (mining share) Index (XAU) closed below the key level of 89 after an intra-day surge above 92, it is still very close to the breakout noted by Investors Intelligence.

Will you continue to use cluster weapons in Yemen? the reporter asked the diplomat. Al-Saud laughed before answering: This is like the question, you stop beating your After the reporter repeated the question, the ambassador again dismissed it, saying You are political operators. not a politician. Speaking at the Annual Arab-US Policymakers Conference last week, al-Saud insisted that the Saudi-led coalition will continue its bombing campaign in Yemen, the Intercept reported. If anyone attacks human lives and disturbs the border, in whatever region, going to continue hitting them, no matter what, said al-Saud. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused the Saudi-led coalition of war crimes following an airstrike on a funeral in Yemen on October 8. In that incident, at least two air-dropped munitions penetrated the roof of a hall containing over 1,000 mourners during the funeral ceremony of Ali al-Rawishan, the father of the Sanaa-based interior minister, Jalal al-Rawishan. At least 140 people were killed and 610 wounded. Despite calls by US officials to review its support for its Middle Eastern ally, Washington continues to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, approving more than $20 billion in military sales in 2015 alone, HRW reports. According to UN data from August this year, the Saudi intervention in Yemen has claimed the lives of at least 10,000 people, including almost 4,000 civilians.

Rwanda & The Philippines rate better than UK for gender equality, study shows By 0 127 Britain is lagging behind countries including Rwanda, the Philippines and Nicaragua in a global ranking of gender parity, slipping to 20th place on the World Economic Forum (WEF) index. Read more The WEF, a not-for-profit based in Switzerland, analyzed data from 144 countries. It found the global gender gap has widened to its largest extent since 2008. It estimates economic gender parity be achieved for at least another 170 years. The US and Australia are even further behind than Britain, however, at 45th and 46th place respectively. The 2016 rankings which take into account key areas such as the economy, politics, education and health mark a slide from ninth position in 2006. Britain sits at number 53 for economic participation. This reflects a drop in the number of women in senior and technical positions, as well as a reduction in the estimated income women earn compared to men. The UK is ranked 24th for political empowerment, because of a fall in the number of women parliamentarians, the WEF said. The figures do not take into account Prime Minister Theresa rise to Downing Street. Read more Rwanda, by contrast, has the highest share of women in parliament globally at 64 percent. Jemima Olchawski, head of policy and insight at the Fawcett Society, told the Express: unacceptable that Britain is languishing at 53rd in the world for economic participation, is only 24th for political empowerment and performs below average compared to our region.

The CDU politician argued that up to Germans to contain Islamisation in Germany, suggesting they do so by recalling Christian traditions. How many Christmas carols do we still know? And how many of them are we passing on to our children and grandchildren? she asked the crowd, rhetorically. Merkel added: You just have to copy a few [sheets of carol music], and ask someone who can play the recorder or the flute [to join in]. Met with some laughter at her suggestion that a woodwind rendition of Christmas songs could pose a challenge to Islamisation, the Chancellor insisted : Yes being serious. Otherwise, we will lose a piece of our homeland. suggestions were met with scepticism from AfD Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Beatrix von Storch, who co-leads the Eurosceptic party.

Soldiers Billed for Thousands After Military Decides Not to Honor Decade-Old Enlistment Bonuses Why, West wondered, would any sane citizen risk his or her life to serve in a military system so corrupt and backward that it would make its veterans pay back their rightfully earned bonuses? What made this move by the Pentagon even more unsettling was how much money it had frivolously wasted on other things that the colonel believed did not deserve to be funded. Here we have a Pentagon stating it will pay for sex change surgery for those who are suffering from gender dysphoria, he wrote. I just want to know, how much money did the Department of Defense pay for those transgender handbooks and training materials?

Why not cut that off and provide the funding for these men and women served? West wrote. This has been 10 years past and now punishing those gone on with their lives? They did nothing wrong, they seek to defraud our nation heck, they put their lives on the line to backfill the manpower shortages made by politicians and government bureaucrats, he continued.

8294|Netflix Ceo: TV’s Future includes Hallucination Pills|Netflix Ceo: Future includes Hallucination Pills 10/27/2016 INDEPENDENT The future of TV might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs, according to the head of Netflix. The threats to the streaming TV company might not be Amazon or other streaming services, but instead pharmacological ways of entertaining people, Reed Hastings has said. And just as films and TV shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments, those same things might eventually become defunct, he said. In the same way that the cinema and TV screen made the opera and the novel much smaller, something else might be on the way to do the same thing, the Netflix boss said at a Wall Street Journal event. Those challenges could come from anywhere, he said. They might not be another form of screen: Is it VR, is it gaming, is it pharmacological? Mr Hastings asked the event. He went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like Netflix. Apparently making reference to The Matrix, he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back. In twenty or fifty years, taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable, Mr Hastings said. And if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological be in real trouble. His references to The Matrix and to being in trouble recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world, but could just as easily be the result of a drug-induced hallucination. Mr Hastings indicate whether or not Netflix would look to make such drugs itself, or how it would fend off any companies that did. But it does sound a little like something out Black Mirror, which Netflix is showing the new season of at the moment.|2022-10-02 01:00:00|FAKE|Madison Wong|The Insight|635214|80310|169|6934|Tanzania|English|2022-09-05 13:00:00|Columna de humor|1|True|367200|2656800|2142|2.816666666666667

8301|Iraqi Christians Hold first mass in over 2 years pray for Trump to Win|IRAQI Christians will pray for Donald election victory after they condemned US Government for abandoning them to the barbaric terror of Islamic State. The Christian community in the latest Iraqi town to be freed from ISIS have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants. The once-bustling Qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 Christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week. Residents who stayed in the town have described how ISIS told every Christian to pay a massive tax, convert to Islam or face execution. Those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that President Obama refused to protect them when largest Christian city fell to ISIS more than two years ago. A man in the village said he hopes Donald Trump a widely favoured candidate in the town will bring a different approach to Iraqi Christians. He told the camera: Obama has never helped the Christians. In fact, he despises them. In the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them. But we have hope in the new president, Trump. Donald Trump has previously spoken up about how Christians have been left to fend for themselves by the US government. A Catholic priest in the town said: The US government led by President Obama could have protected us or at least helped us to protect ourselves. But unfortunately Obama abandoned us, and chose not to get involved. A young girl wearing a crucifix then added: We hope this new guy called Trump will help us more than Obama did. Last Sunday, Father Ammar took mass in a shelled-out Church of the Immaculate Conception for the first time in two years. He said: Yes, they destroyed and burned some houses and churches, but we can rebuild them.

What counts is that we can pray here again The church, still largely in rubble from the chaotic war, is largest and used to regularly host more than 3,000 people a week to its Sunday mass The liberation comes as Kurdish-led forces fight to free both of largest remaining strongholds Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.

8333|Technology Blackout Feared As Solar Storm Hits Earth|Edmondo Burr in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments Yesterday the sun erupted with a huge solar flare sending streams of particles bombarding towards Earth. A solar storm can wreak havoc on electricity power lines and technologies that rely on satellites. People are warned to prepare for the worst in coming days. The Daily Express reports: Solar storms can affect technology here on Earth as the radiation thrown at our planet heat the outer atmosphere, resulting in it expanding. As a result, satellite communications struggle to penetrate the atmosphere, essentially blocking communications which could lead to a lack of GPS navigation, mobile phone signal and satellite TV such as Sky. Furthermore, higher currents in the magnetosphere the magnetic field could result in a surge of electricity in power lines, which can blow out electrical transformers and power stations leading to a temporary loss of electricity in a region although this usually only occurs in areas that are in high altitude. The solar storm is predicted to carry on until October 27 and officials are telling citizens to prepare for the worst. The US Space Weather Prediction Center said: Voltage corrections may be required, false alarms triggered on some protection devices. Drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems. The storm was originally described as a serious G3 level storm, although it was later downgraded to a G2. The UK Met Office said: Elevated solar winds are expected throughout the period, with G1-G2 minor to moderate geomagnetic storms forecast. Greenland However, on the plus side, solar storms can lead to the Northern Lights being visible. As the magnetosphere gets bombarded by solar winds, stunning blue lights can appear over the upper reaches of the Northern hemisphere and the lower parts of the southern hemisphere.|2022-10-07 13:00:00|FAKE|Benjamin Singh|Times Today|370746|76974|466|9295|South Korea|English|2022-09-13 14:00:00|Crónica|0|True|3132000|1062000|1876|7.766666666666667

8336|ISIS shoots down Russian helicopter near Palmyra (VIDEO+PHOTOS)|November 4, 2016 - Fort Russ News - RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski - As previously reported by Russian Spring, media wing, and the Al-Amak agency, on the evening of November 3rd, a Russian helicopter was shot down near Palmyra in the Khveisis village district in the Syrian province of Homs. Later, the Ministry of Defense of Russia denied reports that Russian servicemen were killed. The ministry did confirm that during the execution of a special operation on humanitarian cargo delivery on November 3rd, a Russian military helicopter made an emergency landing 40 kilometers northwest of Palmyra and its crew was successfully evacuated by Russian search and rescue forces. Earlier, ISIS terrorists reported that the Russian armed helicopter was shot down by a guided missile. The terrorists have just published footage of the rescue operation and the destruction of the Mi-35 helicopter in the desert near Palmyra. The video and photos clearly show Russian special forces on armored Tiger cars and KamA3 Vystrel evacuating the crew with an Mi-8 military transport helicopter. During the rescue takeoff, the damaged Mi-35 exploded, after which special forces orderly left the scene on armored vehicles and in the Mi-8. The rescue helicopter shot flares to protect against MPADS. On social networks, it has been suggested that the helicopter could have been detonated by special forces because of the impossibility of taking it back to base. According to another theory, the Mi-35 exploded after being hit by an MPAD rocket fired by militants. The Center for Reconciliation of Warring Parties in Syria subsequently reported the details of the emergency situation: During the inspection of the helicopter by the crew on the scene, the landing area was subjected to mortar fire by militants. The helicopter was damaged, preventing it from independently returning to its air base. The Russian defense ministry also specified that the Mi-35 crew did not suffer and was rapidly evacuated by the search and rescue helicopter to the Russian military base at Hmeimim in the province of Latakia.

Sawmill worker Tom Logan felt left behind by mainstream politics and finds Lady Gaga annoying, so voted for a billionaire whose main interests are money, and himself. Logan said: going to create well-paid blue collar jobs that are full of dignity and pleasingly masculine. I wait to be a hunky steel worker taking home $150,000 a year. I know Donald let me down, because why would someone lie about something going to help them become the most powerful person in the world? However economist Donna Sheridan said: Despite optimism, main business experience is getting idiots to do pointless tasks on a bullshit reality TV show. Therefore his economic plan is likely to be talking about jobs, realising complicated, losing interest and then cutting welfare for all the people who still got jobs. Meanwhile his extreme stupidity will tank the economy, so in a few years main job will be catching squirrels and cooking them on sticks in a ditch.

Donald campaign have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated, but the Republican campaign manager just put the final nail in coffin. In the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it, but she delivered more than viewers were expecting. In a statement that just decimate campaign, she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence. When the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed, a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation, and almost guaranteed to end in incarceration. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days. Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday, is what Conway said on Fox News: What we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does, put Hillary can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out. Call it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks, James and now the FBI, who are all working together to bleach this stain from the White House, but things just looking good for Hillary who had it coming. Hopefully, the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president, make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two. The investigation now is entirely different than the first, considering the fact that it was reopened. For that reason alone, Hillary feel comfortable about the outcome.|2022-09-09 18:00:00|FAKE|Lily Wang|Press Pulse|271969|47112|112|121|Spain|English|2022-09-07 05:00:00|Artículo de opinión|1|True|730800|511200|2226|1.8666666666666667

8351|FBI Wiretapped Corruption Suspect Discussing Clinton Deals|FBI Wiretapped Corruption Suspect Discussing Clinton Deals November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield If you're wondering why Team Hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the FBI, this may be another ingredient in the stew. The Wall Street Journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the FBI, but it's an interesting data point . The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded inside the Clinton Foundation. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. In short, FBI people had material for a case that the government didn't want brought because Team Obama were Hillary backers and the senior leadership in the DOJ saw their careers linked to the rise of Hillary. And so a stand down order was handed down. Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand a person familiar with the matter said. This is what happens when the DOJ has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down. Meanwhile there's little doubt, considering what we already know, that the DOJ people had been updating Hillary's people on the FBI investigation. Should those emails come out, they will be some of the most damning of all. And so Hillary's people panicked and decided to pull the trigger.|2022-09-22 04:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Daily Beacon|27972|38379|759|8870|Italy|English|2022-09-18 06:00:00|Crítica|0|True|1803600|1465200|2104|12.65
8352|US General: Warplanes Will Kill Fleeing ISIS Fighters Around Mosul|Iraqi Govt Warns Civilians Against Fleeing Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This According to Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigan, the commander of US air forces in the Middle East, the anti-ISIS coalition is now planning on carrying out airstrikes against any fleeing ISIS fighters around Mosul, trying to prevent escape from the massive city with aerial surveillance and targeted strikes. This appears to be a response to growing concerns, both within the region and internationally, that the fall of Mosul will mean thousands of seasoned ISIS fighters popping up elsewhere around the world, destabilizing the Middle East and Europe. Preventing them from escaping Mosul, however, raises a major concern that the relative lack of US intelligence on who it is targeting, and determination to shoot first and ask questions later is going to lead to US warplanes attacking groups of fleeing civilians that they come across. The solution to this appears to be preventing civilians from fleeing the city as well, despite it being an open combat zone that will likely be facing months of combat. Iraqi officials are now said to be warning Mosul civilians not to try to escape, insisting they will be safer if they stay put. Staying put in a city during an invasion is far from safe, but suggests US warplanes are going to be particularly indiscriminate in targeting people fleeing Mosul. In the recent offensive against the ISIS city of Manbij, US warplanes killed hundreds of civilians they mistook for ISIS, and Mosul is a much larger city with a lot more people to be mistaken for ISIS.

The interview began with Cuomo telling the former New York City mayor that he smile very much at last Al Smith charity dinner when Hillary Clinton took a few comedic jabs at him: You looked like Grumpy Cat. Sullen and sour, Giuliani said Clinton should be in prison and wearing an orange jumpsuit. But when Rudy began trying to filibuster, Cuomo interrupted him and said he while he might not agree with the decision the FBI made to not charge Clinton with any wrongdoing when it came to her email server, Giuliani entitled to make things up: Next, Giuliani began ranting about some bribe that predated the email controversy, and that was when Cuomo shut him down with one line : My entire life because so accurate and all of a sudden, in Trumpland and the facts are all over the place. As if he been embarrassed enough, Giuliani then attempted to start talking about the recent announcement that Obamacare premiums will rise by as much as 25 percent in 2017: As a result, because the Democrats forced this down the throat, the ACA, they decided to punish them. And they work with the Democrats to fix any of the problems that they could fix. Cuomo was ready for that line, too, and again lit into his guest : Oh, a bunch of nonsense. They created it themselves. They cut out bipartisan support. When it was over with, you could tell by the look on face that he knew he had just been bested. Maybe Trump should rethink letting the unhinged Giuliani be one of his main surrogates.

After 19 months of fighting, it should be clear that there is absolutely no military solution to this conflict. Airstrikes that hit schools, hospitals and other civilian objects have to stop.

So, one proud patriot took retaliation to new heights ensuring liberals stay away from his sign. The unnamed owner of the Trump sign, who is believed to be in Arizona, is aware that his sign may not cost a lot but is worth much more than the plastic printed on based on what it represents a chance to take America back. Hillary-supporters are an odd group of people who seem to believe that the Constitutional right to free speech is only bestowed upon them, along with the power to take it from anyone who says something that they like. Perhaps this the driving purpose behind the nationwide rash of Trump sign theft, paired with the fact that they think that helping by removing these visual statements of support from public view. Either way, where there is a Trump sign, a liberal nearby waiting for their chance to make a stupid statement of their own in stealing it. However, this sign owner beat them to the punch by putting it in a place that was not only impossible to reach but showed his support of the GOP candidate loud and proud. It sat up high in a tall tree, keeping it out of reach for thieving liberals. Taking Trump sign to new heights to prevent it from being stolen and make a bold message at the same time. If liberals really want to show their support for Hillary, have to climb this massive tree and tear it down, but chances are, not as tough as they think they are and prefer to stick to easy to steal signs. We commend the hero for Trump who showed his bravery in putting the sign up so high, knowing that no liberal would dare to go there since so far out of their safe space and more work than they are willing to perform.|2022-09-18 16:00:00|FAKE|Chloe Nguyen|Newsflash|741882|76081|296|1036|Bangladesh|English|2022-09-02 23:00:00|Entrevista|1|True|1501200|144000|2021|4.933333333333334

Little Candace addressed the New Mexico state legislature with an impassioned speech about the need for clean energy and a collective effort to reduce the effects of human consumption on the planet. Good job good job, mom, for telling her exactly what to say! Witnesses were impressed by the maturity of the local second grader and her ability to sound out big words. I believe she was able to memorize all that, witness Anna Hines says. It really change my mind, but she was so adorable up there on that podium! Candace reportedly spoke about her own challenges, like turning the water off while brushing her teeth, as well as the future world she hopes to live in. When I grow up, I hope to live in a world where we can reduce carbon emissions and be a model for the rest of the world, the seven-year-old said, inspiring the room with the beautiful words her mother wrote for her. Her speech gave us all a lot to think about, one state representative says. Namely, how hard the mother must have worked to make this all happen. Does this kid even understand what a carbon emission is? she added. Probably not! I could see her mother sort of mouthing along the words as Candace was speaking, friend of the family June Gordon says. I know why Breanne just speak herself. It would have been less jarring, for sure. Though involvement is clear, the young girl is proud about standing up in public about climate change.

In a statement released after she refused, for the fourth time, to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license, Davis said that [t]o issue a marriage license which conflicts with definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision. I was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk, she continued, and I intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County, but I cannot violate my conscience. That she is an elected official has become a point of contention, because as such she be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme ruling. Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings, which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session, which could be prohibitively expensive. In the meantime, no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses. Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that [s]ince Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform, they want Judge Bunning to impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt. The scene at office this morning was raucous, with supporters of both side lining the walkway into it and occupying the tiny building. Praise the Lord! yelled one, Stand your ground!

8405|"TERROR THREAT WARNING MONDAY | RedFlag News"|CBS NEWS NEW YORK -- CBS News has learned about a potential terror threat for the day before the election. Sources told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that U.S. intelligence has alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda could be planning attacks in three states for Monday. It is believed New York, Texas and Virginia are all possible targets, though no specific locations are mentioned. U.S. authorities are taking the threat seriously, though the sources stress the intelligence is still being assessed and its credibility been confirmed. Counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of abundance of caution. A senior FBI official told CBS News, The counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. Intelligence about potential threats always increases during holiday seasons and when big events are approaching. As Election Day nears, federal law enforcement is planning for several worst-case scenarios.

8408|"Hillary's Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault BRUTALLY Exposed | The Federalist Papers"|Pinterest C.E. Dyer reports that actor James Woods posted a powerful video on Twitter about what happened on Highway 265 in Arkansas over four decades ago that Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton want people to know about. The video chronicled the rape of a 12-year-old Arkansas girl, Kathy Shelton, that occurred on May 10, 1975 when two men lured the girl into their car and brutally assaulted her. James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 20, 2016 This video details the horrific the actions of the attorney who defended one of the rapists: Hillary Clinton. According to the video, child was raped and beaten so brutally that she spent five days in a coma and was left unable to bear children. A local paper mill worker, 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor, was charged with the rape. Then Hillary Rodham became his attorney. Taylor had semen mixed with the 12-year-old blood in his underwear, proving that he committed the crime. In court, Hillary maligned the rape character in order to defend her monster of a client. From the video: attorney went to extraordinary lengths to discredit the child victim, suppressing all oral, written and physical evidence, forcing the 12-year-old to submit to polygraphs and psychiatric evaluations, even accusing the child (who had been a virgin until the attack) of seeking out older men and her rape. The victim has recently come forward to talk about how lies ruined her life, which after the trial spiraled into a struggle with drugs and prison time. Shelton, who has already been put through a truly horrific nightmare, had to hear the tapes released in which Hillary laughed about the trial. Hillary laughed, on tape, about a trial of a man who brutally raped a 12-year old girl and subsequently received less than a year in prison for his horrific crime. Shelton has decided to speak out about her nightmare at the hands of Hillary Rodham. The video ends with a message from Shelton to Clinton, You lied about me. You took me through Hell. Clinton has claimed that she had an obligation to defend Taylor, but she is wrong; she did not have to do what she did. What she put a 12-year-old rape victim through is beyond the pale. Liberals regularly talk about victim blaming and rape culture in America, but where is the outrage about what Clinton did to a 12-year-old rape victim as a defense attorney? What else is there to say really? If you can watch that video and not be utterly and completely disgusted with Clinton, well, God help you.|2022-09-24 20:00:00|FAKE|William Kumar|The Reporter|269830|1|28|3069|Mexico|English|2022-09-14 15:00:00|Editorial|1|True|1152000|2034000|2481|0.4666666666666667

Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. If anybody can sit there and say they think this is a contentious election, then they paying much attention, said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. {snip} Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. If that happens at a school, then certainly concerning. {snip} Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: our schools the best places for that activity to take place?' he said.

All remaining effigy production stations on street corners have closed with immediate effect, with hundreds of 10 year-old street urchins laid off. Despite attempts at buy-outs by foreign effigy firms, it is thought the collapse was due to an unrealistic pricing structure, which completely failed to take account of inflation. Economist James Hampton told us: looked through the figures and I have to agree that the fault clearly lies at the pricing level. Frankly, a for the barely covers the raw materials of the effigy. By the time factored in the wooden trolley, actually making a loss. The tragic thing is that there is still a market need for life-size cloth dolls of Catholic terrorists from the 16th Century. However, taking account of production and marketing costs, a more realistic proposition would have been about £12.30 for the Guy, or in euros, The collapse comes at a time when foreign effigy manufactures have been taking increasing orders for effigies of presidents, prime ministers, book authors and cartoonists, while Apple has recently launched the iGuy, and self-combusting re-usable electronic effigy which can be connected to the iCloud to mutter heresy as it is consumed by the flames. The effigy workforce are today looking for work in industries with similar skill sets, such as working in Build-a-Bear Workshops, sewing together giant bean bags and producing dummies used for bayonet practice.

842|Ted Cruz popularity among Republicans takes a serious nosedive: Gallup|"Texas Sen. Ted popularity among Republicans has plummeted in recent months and now more of them have negative views of him than positive ones, according to Gallup data released Monday. The proportion of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who view Cruz favorably has dropped to 39% down from 61% in January and the share who view him unfavorably has skyrocketed, going from 15% in January to 45% now. Republicans' views of Cruz are now the worst in Gallup's history of tracking the Texas senator, Gallup Editor Frank Newport said. The data comes as Cruz has made several moves to try to shore up support for his campaign and stop Donald Trump from winning enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. He and Ohio Gov. John Kasich had tried to make a deal so Cruz could take on Trump one-on-one in Indiana primary. That appears to have fallen apart. He named Carly Fiorina as his running mate last week, even though he clinched the nomination and it is mathematically impossible for him to do so on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. Cruz said this week that he nevertheless intends to go the distance, ""as long as we have a viable path to victory."" happened to his popularity ratings in the Gallup polling: After a holding period of sorts in March and early April, Cruz's image began to deteriorate significantly in the last two weeks, with his positive and negative lines crossing in the middle of last week, Newport said. At the same time, popularity among Republicans surged in recent weeks, with the amount who view him favorably growing from 53% to 59% and the share who view him negatively shrinking from 41% to 35%. Of course, both still have popularity problems with the general electorate 29% more people have a negative view of Trump than a positive one and 25% more view Cruz negatively than positively."|2022-09-22 04:00:00|REAL|Madison Wong|Sunrise Chronicle|571460|37306|372|3706|Tanzania|English|2022-09-12 02:00:00|Artículo de opinión|0|True|1803600|932400|1869|6.2

The news comes a day before voters in five Northeastern states head to the polls to cast ballots in another round of crucial presidential primaries. Trump is expected to add to his overwhelming delegate lead. ""I have got to get rid of these two guys. I am sorry folks,"" the tycoon told his supporters. Cruz and Kasich almost simultaneously announced Sunday they're coordinating their campaigns to deny the front-runner the 1,237 delegates needed to win the party's nomination before the convention. ""I think, when we're at the convention, the delegates are going to want to know who can beat Hillary,"" Kasich said. The Kasich campaign is backing off in Indiana, giving Cruz a clearer path to victory in next month's primary. In return, the Cruz campaign will ease up to give Kasich a ""clearer the path"" in Oregon and New Mexico. ""Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,"" Cruz's campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said in a statement. ""Not only would Trump get blown out by Clinton or Sanders,"" he warned. ""But having him as our nominee would set the party back a generation."" The Kaisch campaign also released a statement explaining, ""Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee."" ""Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. Desperation!"" he tweeted. Meanwhile, in the Democratic race, there is talk Hillary Clinton is already quietly starting the search for a vice presidential running mate. ""I am just working hard to win on Tuesday,"" said Clinton, who is ahead in all five states voting Tuesday. The former state secretary is virtually assured of winning the Democratic nomination before her party's convention. Even so, rival Bernie Sanders is still promising to stay in the race. ""Well, we're going to have to do obviously, win big in the number of the primaries and caucuses that yet remain,"" the Vermont senator told NBC News Saturday.

Share on Facebook It was reported previously on The Duran that MoveOn a George Soros controlled NGO, is behind the organization of anti-Trump protests across the country. As the protests continue, however, Craigslist has become an important recruitment tool for some of these organizers, and here is what it reveals: Fight the Trump Agenda! hiring Full-Time Organizers 15/hr! reads a Craigslist ad from Washington CAN in Seattle . Activists are promised Medical, Dental, Vision, 401(k), Paid Vacation, Paid Sick Days, Holidays, and Leave of Absence . Washington CAN claims to be the oldest and largest grassroots non-profit with over 35 years of organizational experience. It is unclear whether it has any direct ties to MoveOn, but it certainly be a wild assumption to make under the circumstances. In another instance, a Craigslist ad exposed paid Anti-Trump protesters being recruited for a staged event in Los Angeles. And this time the Soros link is quite clear and in the open. TruthFeed reports: In this case, a Craigslist ad in Los Angeles shows that activists are wanted to block traffic in the heavy traffic intersection of Highlands and Hollywood. an example of a Soros employee literally posing as a protester. Not all that grass roots. Obviously, no one is disputing the fact that there are millions of people unhappy with the election results. Neither is there any doubt that thousands across the the country are protesting genuinely out of emotion and desire to express their discontent. important is that these people realize that they are playing right into the hands of an establishment agenda that have best interests in mind. The election is over and we have a clear winner. The losing side has conceded, admitting that the election was fair and calling for a peaceful transition of power.

8440|"BREAKING: Clinton’s intelligence briefings suspended indefinitely following latest in email scandal | Christian Times Newspaper"|0 SHARE Law enforcement and national intelligence officials have suspended Hillary weekly intelligence briefings after further information regarding the Democratic use of private emails has surfaced. According to sources familiar with the briefing process, senior officials notified the Clinton campaign on Sunday afternoon that several federal agencies no longer believed it was either appropriate or prudent for a candidate to receive classified intelligence briefings while under a significant and ongoing investigation. While the FBI and Department of Justice continue their independent investigations and while the law enforcement community continues to search for answers, it would be unwise to continue national security briefings amidst a very serious investigation concerning threats to national security. It is customary for the major party nominees to receive weekly classified intelligence briefings from senior defense and intelligence officials in order for the eventual president to be fully knowledgeable on matters of national security. Both Clinton and Donald Trump have received these briefings since their respective party conventions in June. On Friday, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, notified Congress that the Bureau was effectively reopening its investigation into use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Comey wrote that new emails had surfaced that led investigators to warrant further examination. According to sources familiar with the investigation the newly-found emails were found on a device of personal aide Huma Abedin. Abedin is married to disgraced NY Congressman Anthony Wiener, and it is believed that the emails were discovered during an ongoing investigation into his sexting scandal. This latest revelation, including the suspension of weekly intelligence briefings, does not bode well for the former Secretary of State in the final days of a heated election.

Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is ""honoring President Obama."" the founder of ISIS. He's the founder! He founded ISIS, the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. I would say the co-founder would be Hillary Clinton, Trump added. He went on to criticize decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. We should never have gotten out the way we got out, he said. We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East."" Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out, he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the disastrous decisions that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims."|2022-10-08 03:00:00|FAKE|Aria Shah|City Beat|315038|28941|216|9367|France|English|2022-09-01 10:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|10800|3182400|1803|3.6

Like feuding mafia families that no longer have enough turf to exploit, they will begin to turn on each other. There are many predicting the manner in which the dominos will fall, but who can know with any certainty? There are simply too many variables and too many factors that are already far beyond the breaking point. The noose is being tightened around all our necks from countless directions. The AT&T purchase of Time Warner (and thus CNN News) is just another sign of the rapid power structure consolidation. Those who attempt to stand up to the fascist state are treated brutally, as the Dakota pipeline protesters now know. The hypocrisy of environmentalists like Leonardo DiCaprio (and organizations like National Geographic) is perplexing and disappointing. The newly released film ""After The Flood (by DeCaprio and National Geographic) was disappointing and unfortunately only a half truth. The US military continues to bomb the forces that are actually fighting ISIS, why? Has the human race overshot the planet's ability to support the population?

8451|Homeschool Families Targeted In District’s ‘Operation Round Up’|Off the Grid News by Daniel Jennings A public school official in Florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated including homeschool families. It is all part of an anti-truancy initiative called Operation Round Up, in which residents of Jackson County, Florida, are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police. A truancy report can lead to a home check by deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents, TV station WJHG reported. The policy of the Jackson County School District is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants. Sometimes if these citizens call me, I have no way of knowing, Shirl Williams, director of student services for the school system, told the TV station. So if a nosy neighbor, be a nosy neighbor. Just call me and let me check out the situation. Williams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate. Sometimes the community will see them around town and they think, not being Sometimes the community is right, Williams said. Home School Legal Defense Association attorney TJ Schmidt wrote Williams and the Jackson County superintendent, saying that while truancy is a problem, homeschoolers should not be targeted. Your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think being educated, the letter read. In our opinion, this is a threatening practice, and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community.

8464|Syrian Army Enters Metro Damascus Town, Driving Rebels Further Back|Rebels Blame Internal Fights for Growing Losses by Jason Ditz, October 31, 2016 Share This The Syrian Army has entered the town of Tel Kurdi , on the outskirts of Damascus, entering the area over the weekend and pushing into yet another rebel-held area, bringing their forces yet closer to the rebel city of Douma, the last major rebel holding around the capital. Tel Kurdi, like all the remaining rebel areas in Ghouta, was under siege for some time, and the rebel forces within fell back almost immediately, with no reports of major fighting, and the rebels bragging of a scorched earth policy destroying everything of value on their way out. One of the members of the rebel council blamed the mounting losses on internal fights among the fashions. Indeed, over the past several months a lot of towns and villages in the area have fallen, either in military offensives or in negotiated pullouts. The negotiated pullouts have been the most effective way to displace large amounts of rebels lately, with the rebels getting sent north into Nusra Front territory around Idlib. This is increasingly boiling down to government control of the area around Damascus, and increased rebel influence in the north.

We had a group of 30-35 attend, including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three non-libertarian sites that he reads. We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time. The organizer of the evening, Steve in Dallas, circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv. Some participants had already left by then, so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop, please ping me at yves_at_nakedcapitalism.com and send your coordinates to Steve. Please put Dallas Meetup in the subject line. At the end of the evening, Steve raised an important issue: tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media, with much less success than like. I volunteered that most people want to question authority, and that going outside the mainstream media was tantamount to admitting that the traditional press was wrong, or doing a superficial job.

Given the incentives built into politics as usual , public/private pay-to-play just make is the only possible maximization of the political system .

All the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.

(VIDEO) By Carrie MacDonald on October 27, 2016 Subscribe Ivana Trump, the first wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, confirmed what many of us have been thinking for a long time now: Trump is a childish buffoon. Her story of a young Donald Trump on the ski slopes is telling of the temperament we see in the nominee now. Ivana Trump: Could Not Take Trump biographer Michael spoke with Ivana Trump about her marriage to The Donald, and she remembered a time he took her skiing. This was early on, before they married, and one would think Donald would want to show his best side, right? No. You see, Ivana neglected to tell the young Donald Trump that she was a very accomplished skier. According to Ivana Trump, Donald skied down the slope first, and then: He goes and stops, and he says, on, baby. Come on, I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. He could not take it. He could not take it. She said he stormed off, saying: not going to do this for anybody, including Ivana. We all know by now that Donald Trump is a man who like to lose. Ever. He is a man easily baited, easily goaded, and he has the temper of a petulant child. His outbursts have sparked the hashtag #trumpertantrum . Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was correct when she said, in her speech at the Democratic National Convention: A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Nor is a man who storms off in a huff when bested by his girlfriend on the ski slopes. Donald Trump: Loved To also said that Donald told him how he loved a good fight. I loved to fight. I always loved to fight. All types of fights. Any kind of fight, I loved it, including physical. a word for people who act like that: Bully. Of course, Trump has put his childish, bullying ways on display for the world during this election cycle. Ivana just happened to be one of his earlier victims.

A working paper produced in September 2015 by John Hamre, the policy board chairman, called for an immediate resumption of Navy warship passages to prevent China from taking over the strategic Southeast Asian waterway. The internal document was disclosed Monday by WikiLeaks as part of its latest batch of hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, campaign chairman for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. Data such as engagement with tweets or Facebook Live videos have been taken into account. The result is that Trump has overtaken the engagement numbers of Barack peak in 2008 the year he came into power by 25 percent. Rai said that his AI system shows that candidate in each election who had leading engagement data ended up winning the elections. If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest, Rai wrote in a report sent to CNBC.

Terrorism is like a snake: you turn your back on it and it bites you. play with it, she said in an interview to China Radio International. Zakharova remarked that Western and regional countries have invested a lot of forces and means in terrorist groupings. But these are terrorists, and they be flirted with, Zakharova added. In the opinion, the actions of the American side, which is not allowing Jebat Al-Nusra to be destroyed, are a clear manifestation of the fact that they are protecting it.

855|Clinton rails against big banks, but refuses to release Wall Street speeches|Fresh off a New York primary win that all but gave her the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton channeled a little Bernie Sanders on Thursday, railing against big banks while at the same time side-stepping one of Sanders' campaign demands to release transcripts of her Wall Street speeches. Speaking during a Good Morning America Town Hall after her 58-42 drubbing of Sanders in primary, Clinton said the two candidates generally agreed on many issues, and she used rhetoric reminiscent of the Vermont senator to drive her point home. I know that we both Senator Sanders and I we want to tackle inequality, Clinton said. We want to raise the minimum wage. We want to make sure that people who are putting our economy at risk are reined in, regulated. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail. We share those views. But many of critics, particularly on the left, question her authenticity on the topic of income inequality. At issue is a series of highly-paid speeches she made to security firms and banks, such as Goldman Sachs, after her tenure as Secretary of State. The content of those speeches has remained private, and Sanders has called on Clinton to release them. Clinton has refused. Now a new request to release transcripts of speeches that have been given, Clinton said. When everybody agrees to do that, I will as well. Because I think important we all abide by the same standard. Clinton said she regret giving the controversial speeches. I, like everybody who served as secretary of state, have a unique perspective, she said, citing Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as former secretaries of state who have made speeches after leaving office. When you leave the secretary of state office, people from all perspectives want to know, do you going on in the I think actually a useful conversation.

Wait. not a saying at all. Well, that is what Politico must think and certainly what they did. You wonder why we trust liberal news media According to The Blaze : Politico ran a story Thursday night that suggested that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump Victory fund had transferred no money to the Republican National Committee in the month of October. The actual truth is that Trump has transferred about $2.2 million so far this month, along with several hundred thousand dollars to various state committees. It is not clear what caused the error, but site now reads: This story has been corrected. An earlier version said the RNC did not receive any money directly from Trump Victory. POLITICO regrets the error. Of course, even that small amount of money would seem shocking to Politico considering their candidate of choice flies around the world in a Boeing on charitable donations, kowtows to the wealthy for donations to the slush-fund, and only wears the finest of all pantsuits. funds may be small because, unlike the Hillz, he is not a part of the political establishment. Although the donations are anemic this year, and come nowhere near the monstrous amount of dollars the Clintons are using to dupe Americans into standing with her, Donald Trump has a real chance at winning this election. Despite the attempts by the liberal media to silence real stories of Clinton corruption, despite the smoke and mirrors the Clinton campaign created to make Trump look like a monster, still in the fight. take a lesson from Politico and continue to raise suspicions over liberal media sources. It is pretty bad that a press is so incredibly desperate to cast Trump in a poor light that they resort to flat out lies.

The hand was totally peng mate, claimed Mr Webber during a catch up with Wunderground earlier today.

Rubio, a former presidential candidate and member of the Senate intelligence committee, challenged his understanding of the factions on the ground. Murphy, a two-term congressman, reverted to a familiar line. It just goes back to the same point, he said, that Senator Rubio continues to support Donald Trump, and it is shameful that he stands there with him. The audience laughed, faintly, at one of nearly 20 mentions of the Republican presidential nominee during the one-hour debate. When Murphy next mentioned Trump, Rubio was quick with a rejoinder based on a famous Joe Biden rebuke of Rudy Giuliani : A noun, a verb and Donald Trump: his answer to everything.

What started as a handful of Donald Trump supporters heckling Ted Cruz from across the street outside a campaign stop here Monday afternoon turned into a contentious debate between the Republican presidential hopeful and at least one of them on the eve of the Indiana primary. The Trump backers yelled jeers like ""Lyin' Ted!"" and ""Hey Cruz, do the math!"" a reference to Cruz's delegate deficit in the GOP race. Some Cruz supporters tried to drown out the men out with pro-Cruz chants and counter-insults. Then, when it looked like Cruz was about to leave and things would simmer down, the senator strolled over to engage the men, who were smoking and holding up Trump signs. In a back-and-forth with one of the men, who afterward repeatedly refused to provide his name to reporters and said he was from Ohio, Cruz said of Trump: ""This man is lying to you and he's taking advantage of you."" He added: ""If I were Donald Trump I wouldn't have come over and talked to you. ... I would have told the folks over there go over and punch those guys in the face."" The man accused Cruz of lying on that point. Cruz said it was beyond dispute. ""You'll find out tomorrow. Indiana don't want you,"" the man told him at one point. He also repeatedly interrupted Cruz and tried to mock him. ""Sir, America is a better country "" said Cruz. ""Without you,"" the man quipped. ""A question everyone here should ask "" the senator later said. ""Are you Canadian?"" another man said. ""Are you Canadian?"" the man Cruz was speaking to repeated. The question Cruz was actually trying to raise: ""Do you want your kids repeating the words of Donald Trump?"" The man also took aim at Cruz over his remark that he would ""carpet bomb"" Islamic State militants. ""Those are your words. Carpet bomb. I added the women and children because that's what you're going to be doing when you carpet bomb somewhere."" Cruz shot back: ""It's interesting that you added women and children because your candidate, Donald Trump, came out and said he would order our military to kill the women and children, the wives and children, of terrorists, which is a war crime."" Polls show Trump is leading Cruz in Indiana. A loss would be a devastating blow to Cruz's already struggling campaign. Trump is also campaigning in the state Monday."|2022-09-26 21:00:00|REAL|Emily Parker|Voice of the Nation|541580|55711|333|521|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-14 09:00:00|Carta al editor|1|True|1130400|2210400|2291|5.55

The big deal? A four-state Dakota Access Pipeline which threatens to uproot sacred burial ground, poison the Missouri river, and make null an 1881 treaty ensuring the property belongs to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. In addition to being maced and beaten with batons, activists have been tased and even shot with rubber bullets. Despite the violence taking place, tribal leaders continue to ask all water protectors to maintain peaceful relations and rely on prayer as the only weapon used to halt construction of the DAPL. After watching videos of the mass arrests and beating that have taken place, many have asked how those employed by the State can continue to terrorize weaponless protesters. Surely, some form of cognitive dissonance must be taking place? For some, most likely, and undoubtedly what inspired at least two officers to turn in their badges today. According to an activist named Redhawk, there have been reports of at least two officers turning in their badges after acknowledging that the battle against the American people is not what they signed up for. On Facebook, the activist wrote: You can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions. We must keep reminding them they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against this pipeline as well. Some are waking up. The comments on the ordeal have been quite positive. Charlotte Holywater Vincent wrote, Brave to stand up for what is right ! To hand over years of training and service in a little metal badge and then stand on the side of humanity. Ron Hemming, who reportedly is a retired deputy in Washington, shared his thoughts: As a retired deputy in Washington state, I would have refused to go on a detail such as this. As I am also part native blood, I stand with my relatives on the front line protecting the water from the black snake.

In an interview with the humanitarian organization Roads of Success, Syrian mom Alice Assaf went into chilling detail about the atrocities the jihadists committed about two years ago in the town of Douma, explaining that some of the youngsters were even decapitated in front of their parents, according to the Express. We heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them, Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine, Assaf said, according to media reports. They were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old. ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. My son said to me, mother, I want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,' Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. Assaf added, I asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.' Dr. Isaac reported the savage slayings to a member of the UK Parliament, Fiona Bruce, who recently recounted the horrifying testimony to her colleagues in open chambers. She showed us recent film footage of herself talking with than who had seen their own children crucified, Bruce said. She told us of a mother with a two-month-old baby. When [ISIS] knocked at the front door of her house and ordered the entire family out, she pleaded with them to let her collect her child from another room, Bruce said.

The victory of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential elections proves that political class and the mainstream US media are completely detached from the actual US electorate, Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams told Sputnik. More than anything else, Donald victory has proven the entire political class in Washington and especially the mainstream media that does their bidding to be completely out of touch with the American people, McAdams said. According to McAdams, over the course of the election, the mainstream media has proven not to be independent resources seeking out inconvenient truths, but rather a lapdog to the power elite.

8648|Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver Expected Yields|Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver Expected Yields 10/31/2016 ALL GOV The controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat. But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides. The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides. Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. An analysis by The Times using U.N. data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany . Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found there was little evidence that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the United States had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops. At the same time, herbicide use has increased in the United States, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the United States has fallen behind biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides. One measure, contained in data from the U.S. Geological Survey , shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides. Since GM crops were introduced in the United States two decades ago for crops like corn, cotton and soybeans, the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third, but the spraying of herbicides, which are used in much higher volumes, has risen 21 percent. By contrast, in France, use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen 65 percent and herbicide use has decreased 36 percent.

Foremost now in all the post-election sound and fury is the new United States of Amurkier, according to analyst Dmitri Globulus, of the website Times Die Hard. Hillary and the Clintonistas are lining up all the culprits for the defeat--since that obviously had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton herself--starting with FBI Director James Comey. It wasn't her politics of more of the same, including beefing up wars in the middle east, continuing the policies of Obama, and renewing hostility with Russia. No, it was Comey. Comey was very nasty in announcing new emails had been discovered in Anthony Weiner's computer, which tipped the balance. If only he had kept his mouth shut, according to the Clinton DieHards, she would have prevailed. Her failure to talk Amurexit had nothing to do with it, whereas Trump continually signaled ""The System is Rigged!"" But Dmitri Globulus says Trump was on target, not Clinton. ""It's basically a grapes of wrath syndrome. Too much imbalance in wealth distribution, severe economic depression, and Government Pretense of a 'recovery' that fooled nobody."" Add in free trade ideas and shipping jobs to the cheapest labor markets in the world leaving ordinary citizens out of work and you've got a lot of anger. Add in Obamacare with its premiums going up and the Pharmaceutical Industry leaping up its profit margins--more anger. Add in stupid wars with the only logic behind them making money for the munitions people and The War Establishment--more anger. Add in refugees fleeing somewhere, anywhere, with their countries either blasted economically or from continuing, monstrous war--more anger. Add in Washington-As-Usual with its talking heads and scoffing and labeling its opposition ignorant and stupid--more anger. The Brexit people across the Atlantic are calling out: ""Welcome to the Club! We're done with the Plutocrat Trans-nationalists!"" Many Amurkier people have responded: ""So are we! Time to change it!"" The Clintonistas meanwhile continue to enjoy their outrage.

Several complaints were lodged about the ad which producers say attempts to be all-inclusive with the people it features. Produced by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), the ad titled You Never Lamb Alone features a white TV presenter quickly being switched with a Bengali-Australian actor Arka Das who introduces a range of ethnicities and sexual orientations as he moves towards a barbeque cooking lamb - the meat that discriminate. Most of the complaints to the Advertising Standards Board of Australia centered on the opening switch of white TV presenter Luke Jacobz to Das, after Jacobz utters the line here to address concerns that too many perky white males are contributing to the lack of diversity on our screens. This advertisement clearly states many WHITE in its commercial which is highly offensive, one complaint read, according to Bandt . Pointing out race and gender in an advertisement and then denigrating such race or gender is both racist and sexist, another read.

Crooked Hillary used Clinton Foundation funds to illegally pay for her wedding! That is called Wikileaks busted Chelsea and Hillary Clinton today by leaking an email from (Clinton advisor) Doug Band to (Hillary campaign chairman) John Podesta. In the email, Band accuses Chelsea of charity fraud (paying for her own wedding with charity cash laundered thru the rotten clinton foundation racket). How many Clinton crimes will it take for Hillary voters to awaken? Many never will. But the world run by naive simpletons. Clinton crimes run so deep that adults are stepping up to squash Hillary and round up her crooked henchmen. Will that happen in time to stop Hillary from stealing the rigged 2016 election?

8676|Tory Councillor Say Homeless People Should Be ‘Eliminated’|Carol Adl in News , UK // 0 Comments A Tory councillor believes that homeless people in Bradford city centre should be by scruff of the and The comments by David Heseltine, a Conservative Party Councillor in Bradford caused outrage during a meeting of the regeneration overview and scrutiny committee. He said : The tramps and drunks sleeping in doorways. What we need to do is get them by the scruff of the neck and deal with them. People have said go into Bradford if they were eliminated. He claimed that while plans to redevelop the city centre were all well and good, the investment had been ruined by the homeless. So what exactly does Mr Heseltine envisage when he suggests grabbing the homeless by the scruff of the neck and eliminating them? EvolvePolitics reports: Why Councillor Heseltine believes that perpetrating an assault on the homeless would rectify the problem is a mystery. He would be better advised to encourage his colleagues to work towards providing people with homes, opportunities for employment, improving mental health services and providing interventions for alcohol and drug addiction. The Councillor said that he had spoken to people who claimed that they would not visit Bradford city centre due to the number of drinkers and beggars. Heseltine is correct in his assertion that Bradford council like many other councils places the town centre aesthetic above the needs of those that live in and around them. However, his suggestions for dealing with the problem of homelessness are utterly reprehensible. These are people, not dogs or vermin to be disposed of to make your town look just a little better. Most people are never more than three paychecks away from being homeless. Our elected representatives would be well advised to remember that.|2022-10-06 23:00:00|FAKE|Ava Murphy|City Beat|770390|14052|575|7227|Brazil|English|2022-09-03 02:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|154800|3081600|1779|9.583333333333334

8680|Tom deLonge: Changing the cynical views of youth towards government|"link IMO, here is what is happening. you guys are jumping to conclusions by not having any context and taking this at face value. I've been into this a very long time, and with that perspective I see some repeating patterns. To the point of the op, this is the same old same old--with a new generation of players. We've seen the same exact thing over the last 70 years with people like George Adamski, David Fry, Billy Meier, William Moore, and Steven Greer. It's the same story: A privileged individual is given the keys to open a few doors about what ""really is happening."" Tom DeLonge believes (and that's all it takes) he has been given these keys, and he's running with it, as his handlers knew he would. Tom sees this whole ""Sekret Machines"" schtick as a ""franchise."" That's how he talks about it. when he says ""franchise"" he's talking in George Lucas Star Wars terms with movie tie-ins, merchandise, graphic novels, coffee cups, t-shirts, and back packs. That's his vision for this. He sees opportunity to make this thing BIG. Now, he's been writing to Podesta and who knows who else, but he and we know Podesta has an interest in UFOs. So Podesta is seen by Tom as an ""in"" for what he perceives as the new administration and he is offering himself as a legitimate representative of his generation. His statement to Podesta is one of POSITIONING HIMSELF as a natural go-between for these issues--especially with ""young people."" It has nothing really to do with young people being disenfranchised and cynical and everything to do with Tom DeLonge taking an important position vis-a-vis ""Disclosure."" If DeLonge pulls this off it won't be Stephen Bassett of the Paradigm Research Group or Steven Greer, who ""once had dinner with the head of the CIA"" whose name is forever associated with ""Disclosure."" The name everyone will remember is Tom DeLonge. THAT'S what is happening here. DeLonge is attempting to position himself to take major advantage of what he now thinks is reality, and which also includes a major Star-Wars-sized ""franchise"" that has the potential of turning him from a mere multi-millionaire into something much larger. Of course, he may also be a dupe and or delusional, but he may not know that yet. edit on 10/27/2016 by schuyler because: (no reason given)"|2022-10-07 06:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|Voice of the Nation|124535|2053|340|3882|France|English|2022-09-29 09:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|2426400|3106800|2281|5.666666666666667

For America, Obama, Jarrett, Soros and their minions, in agreement with this savage group, are the ones bringing karma to her doorstep for kicking God out. The Godless liberals/communists are begging for these savages to destroy them by taking on the ways of evil, such as, abortion, perversions of sex and marriage, drugs, child abuse, etc. Do liberals really expect a positive outcome from having absolutely no morals and standards? They are probably quite a few of the same souls from the time of Pompeii, Soddom & Gomorrah, Roman and Greek Empires, Atlantis and Lemuria review history and note where they and their country ended up. Atlantis & Lemuria crumbled and sank and now lies deep within the bottom of the ocean. We can still see the end result of Pompeii.

How many lifetimes will they put themselves and the rest of society through this total destruction of their hearts, minds and souls?

8731|Clinton emails: FBI director ignored Attorney General's advice not to 'take action that could influence election'|Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Clinton emails: FBI director ignored Attorney General's advice not to 'take action that could influence election' Source: The Independent FBI director James Comey reportedly ignored the advice of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who urged him not to thrust the controversy over Hillary emails back into headlines less than a fortnight from election day. US Department of Justice officials, Democrats and even some Republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the announcement, on Friday, that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails, which Mr Comey said may be pertinent to the investigation into Ms use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. According to a report from the New Yorker , Ms Lynch expressed her preference that Mr Comey uphold the Justice Department's longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election. The FBI director, however, said that he felt compelled to do otherwise. Writing in the Washington Post , former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Mr decision was a troubling violation of long-standing Justice Department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the chief investigative official. The emails were discovered in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI director wrote in a letter to Republican congressional committee chairs on Friday. That separate case, it later emerged, concerns disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner , who is under investigation for allegedly sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr Weiner is the estranged husband of Ms closest aide, Huma Abedin , and the emails were found on one or more electronic devices belonging to the couple, which had been seized as part of the Weiner probe. The FBI is now investigating whether those emails contained any classified information.|2022-09-11 00:00:00|FAKE|William Kumar|Metro News|833747|9312|562|726|DR Congo|English|2022-09-04 01:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|838800|237600|2001|9.366666666666667

But the US is struggling to keep those nations exclusively buying US arms. big loss was from Malaysia , which has announced they intend to buy littoral mission ships from China, instead of the United States. Details on the decision-making process are unclear, but the US problems with their own littoral combat ships breaking down, so that hurt their chances. a comparatively small deal, but part of a growing trend. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been making headlines for weeks with his interest in ending long-standing reliance on the US. While this has grown into complaints about general US-Philippines relations, one of the early grievances was his not liking the US dictating arms sales, and expressing interest in buying from China and Russia instead. If these countries start buying their arms from China, have a strong incentive to resolve maritime disputes with China diplomatically, which could severely limit their interest in having warships patrolling through the area to confront China.

8737|Assange claims ‘crazed’ Clinton campaign tried to hack WikiLeaks|Julian Assange has claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by WikiLeaks. Despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the US election is over, the website will continue publishing, according to Assange. Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. Assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign leading them to attack WikiLeaks. They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile, he added. decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a strategic position so that its policy of non-intervention be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador. He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being controlled by Clinton supporters. The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. I think any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton, he said. Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing what in their mind is white trash.

Huge, cataclysmic tremors felt on North America faultlines have led scientists from leading institutions to report that the planet, once estimated to live on for some 4 billion years in one form or another, may not live as long as once predicted. We are compelled to alter our projections for life expectancy dramatically, explained lead researcher at the Institute of Studies, Professor Thalia Ambrosio. While vital signs initially looked normal enough, now looking at 4 years tops, Prof. Ambrosio added. raising the end of the world alert level from red to a tanned, leathery orange. This startling news has had a profound effect on the population, with many asking what they can do to prolong the life of the planet. However, scientists were quick to point out that the cut in life expectancy is not something that is likely to change. We know people are keen to help, but honestly, some people are under the impression moving to Canada will somehow help the planet which we must point out really do anything, Prof. Ambrosio concluded.

8746|Brexit Ruling Just Latest Tactic to Block Will of the People|Brexit Ruling Just Latest Tactic to Block Will of the People November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield After the referendum made Brexit possible, I warned that the establishment would do everything possible to stop it. That should not come as a surprise to anyone. Brexit was very much a popular rebellion whose centers were well outside the centers of power. The establishment is culturally and politically hostile to it. And one of the most basic ways that the system has of sabotaging policies it doesn't like is to swamp them in procedural red tape and as much politicking as possible so as to make them unviable. Doing that to a Brexit is trickier, but it's still happening. The same old game plan is to just bog it down as much as possible until its motive energy runs down. It's worked in the past. It may not work this time. But that won't stop them from trying. Rerun Brexit through Parliament and maximize the wrangling. The Court's ruling is certain to do that.

875|The Battle of New York: Why This Primary Matters|"It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls. Trump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet. A big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals. ""We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!"" Sanders recently told supporters. While wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important. Trump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention. ""We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,"" Trump urged supporters. Meanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination. Despite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November. ""Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,"" Cruz promised his supporters. ""We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people."" For now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states.

Somebody asks a question the media intervened to spin yet, and a bit of truth peeks out about what the public really thinks.

Now, according to him, the NATO authorities intend to prepare significant ground forces, which would be capable of containing 'Russian aggression'. What for are these acts?Andrey Koshkin, Ph.D. in Political Science:'First of all, it should be noted that we've caught the US at double standards in politics, and policy of the NATO military political alliance is the same. They react to Washington's order, which says that they should build-up potential, as Russian aggression is to be shown constantly. And how can it be shown? In order to show Russia's aggression, its own residents and armed forces should be shaken up. How can they be shaken up? Just switched to a more high level of readiness. That is what they are doing. If the Armed Forces are switched to a more high level of readiness, common residents of the Western states will react immediately. Yes, the danger is real if the Armed Forces are put on a war footing, and these are funds after all.

Davis, who claimed she was acting under authority and quickly became a hero for many religious conservatives, has been hit with an appeal seeking to have her pay her legal fees, which total $233,058. legal troubles began soon after her stunt last summer when four couples (two same-sex and two straight) sued her for her refusal to carry out national law. The case gained national attention after Davis was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court and made a martyr of herself. The suit itself was ultimately resolved earlier this year after governor changed state law to the effect that county clerks no longer authorize marriage licenses. Davis has not been responsible for her own legal fees, as the anti-LGBT non-profit Liberty Counsel has offered her pro bono services. Now, however, she may finally be forced to pay up as the ACLU, on behalf of the four plaintiff couples, is appealing to US District Judge David Bunning seeking an order allowing them to recoup their legal expenses. Rowan County, which Davis serves as county clerk, has already stated that it will not pay the costs, arguing that Davis was acting on her own behalf rather than the It remains to be seen how the appeal will play out.

Via YourNewsWire As Hillary campaign implodes amid the FBI actively pursuing five separate probes, including one into claims that the Clinton Foundation is connected to a Washington pedophile ring, there is still a possibility that Democrats will stubbornly vote her in on Tuesday. Yesterday during an interview on Fox News, Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul explained the process. If the investigation goes forward and it looks like an indictment is pending, at that point in time under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial. It would go to the Senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place, McCaul told Fox Bill Hemmer.

8781|CodeSOD: The Wisdom of the Ancients|As Halloween descends upon us, mysterious emails start reaching our inbox. These plaintive missives are but the screams of the damned, encoded and sent over SMTP. For example, someone known to us only as DBA Guy sent an email with this subject: Silver bullet SQL scalar function built by the Ancient Ones. These ancient ones obviously did not come from the Euclidian plane we know so well, but obviously from a twisted, higher dimensional space where there exist no right angles. The code itself, is simple: /* Name fnValueChanged Purpose: Returns a value based on the parameters passed in which will tell the user whether or not 2 values have changed Usage Select dbo.fnValueChanged(Parameter1,Parameter2,Parameter3,ParameterN...) Returns tinyint */ ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[fnValueHasChanged] ( @pOldValue varchar(255), @pNewValue varchar(255), @pItemType varchar(40) -- to be used if we need to do date comparisions etc. ) RETURNS int AS Begin Declare @vHasChanged tinyint set @vHasChanged = ( Case When IsNull(@pNewValue, '') <> IsNull(@pOldValue, '') and @pNewValue Is Not Null Then 1 Else 0 End ) RETURN ( @vHasChanged ) End Given an old value and a new value, determine if different. awkward and strange, with dead parameters coming to us from across the aeons, and an awkward Case statement when an If would probably be clearer and easier to understand. But how, praytell, is this code used ? CarPassword = ( Case When dbo.fnValueHasChanged(@LocPasswordOld, @LocPassword, NULL) = 1 then @LocPassword Else @LocPasswordOld End ) The code which calls the function must be the same as the code within the function. Thus, we have a case within a case, a mystery within a mystery, and a function which has ben handed down to us from the ancient ones.

8783|Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump|You are here: Home / US / Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump Christian Pastor Jailed by Iran Reveals STUNNING Truth About Trump October 29, 2016 Pinterest Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was jailed in Iran because of his faith for three and a half years. During that extremely difficult time, Abedini said that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump met with his family and gave them $10,000. Abedini wrote about how Trump helped his family in a recent Facebook post and noted that he had already voted for Trump last week in early voting. I am finally free in a free country, he wrote. Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president. And most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates. In contrast, Clinton did nothing for him or his family: As a woman who says she stands for rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage. Christian Today reported : Abedini strongly defended Trump from attacks on his character, saying God used flawed men to lead nations in the Old Testament, likening him to King Cyrus of Persia, a figure mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible. According to Bible experts, Cyrus was a great pagan king who ruled Persia from 539 to 530 B.C. Under his rule, Jews were first allowed to return to Israel after 70 years of captivity. Abedini wrote: In the past few months, we have seen how media is attacking Donald past. I have even heard so many people said he is not a Christian. Of course, only God knows this for sure, but what I see is God is using him and anointed him. It seems to me that he is the Cyrus of our modern day, but like you and me, he is a flawed man, in the process of spiritual growth. When we hear that this candidate or that candidate is not a strong Christian or has a past that disqualifies him to be the President of the United States, my answer is that we are a nation, a people who are also sinners, saved by grace. How often do you hear about kind things Clinton has done for others like this? I think of any. words are extremely powerful and certainly something anyone who is on the fence about Trump should read.|2022-09-28 17:00:00|FAKE|Chloe Nguyen|Metro News|305382|29566|171|1446|Colombia|English|2022-09-24 22:00:00|Entrevista a fondo|0|True|2041200|2368800|2480|2.85

879|Bernie Sanders Blames Closed Primaries As Path To The Nomination Narrows|Sen. Bernie Sanders suffered a crushing defeat Tuesday night, losing three out of five states to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton by significant margins at press time. In a speech shortly after most polls closed at 8 pm, Sanders blamed his loss on closed primaries, which barred independent voters from participating in four of five primaries. He did win Rhode Island, which allows participation by independent voters. In a general election, Democrat, independent, Republican, has the right to vote for president. The elections are not closed primaries, Sanders said. Those folks and independents all over this country will be voting in November for the next president of the United States. And in most cases, we win the independent vote by a margin. Clinton made another strong showing Tuesday night with non-white voters and city dwellers. Exit polls indicated strong support in cities like Baltimore. Baltimore pastor Jamal Bryant, who had been working to get out the vote for Sanders in inner city, lamented that the Vermont senator has not done better with communities of color, who have overwhelmingly backed Clinton. He more than any candidate, Democrat or Republican, speaks to our issues, Bryant told ThinkProgress, noting his progressive racial justice and criminal justice proposals. I would have thought have more black and brown supporters. But been a translation problem. The gatekeepers have already sworn allegiance to the Clinton dynasty, and most people go with a name already familiar with. As his path to the nomination narrows, campaign is reassessing the prospects following losses, and key supporters are admitting that it is increasingly unlikely he can clinch the nomination. His campaign and supporters have already turned their attention to how Sanders can use his popularity and influence to shape the Democratic Party even if he is not its standard bearer. The New York Times reported that aides to Sanders have started pressing party officials for a major role in drafting the platform for the Democratic National Convention in July, especially on including issues like a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, breaking up Wall Street banks, and banning natural gas fracking.|2022-10-08 15:00:00|REAL|Avery Kim|Sunrise Chronicle|730591|42769|255|4450|South Korea|English|2022-09-28 17:00:00|Crónica|0|True|3225600|2368800|2206|4.25

Nowadays this seems to be impossible, due to the existence of people who obviously must be racist, misogynist knuckle-dragging arsewipes since they disagree with me.

8808|Chinese University Sells HIV Testing Kits in Vending Machine|Chinese University Sells HIV Testing Kits in Vending Machine China has a 43% year-over-year increase of the disease Image Credits: David Pursehouse/Flickr . China has experienced such a growth rate of HIV in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves: by placing an HIV testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks. China has seen a 43% year-over-year increase in infection rates, which likely prompted Southwest Petroleum University in Nanchong City in Sichuan Province to install the test kits . Sichuan Province is one of the top three provinces in China with a disproportionately high rate of HIV/AIDS. Together, with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease, the three account for over half of the cases of HIV/AIDS in the entire country. 80% of new HIV cases occur due to homosexual activity. The kits retail for $4.40 and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention. Those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory, and then access the results online. This can all be done completely anonymously. Similar kits can be purchased online, but they retail for around $45. The cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible. Reports state that the Chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about HIV or AIDS. Many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality. Those who do have HIV are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with same-sex encounters. The disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men, but as with anywhere else, women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected. Doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with HIV/AIDS in China lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) states that there are currently about half a million people in China living with HIV or AIDS, however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting.|2022-10-02 01:00:00|FAKE|Madison Wong|Evening Echo|64976|1330|305|6477|Uganda|English|2022-09-05 09:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|352800|2656800|2301|5.083333333333333
8810|Facebook says users can't stop it from using biometric data|Facebook says users can't stop it from using biometric data Bloomberg Facebook Inc.'s software knows your face almost as well as your mother does. And like mom, it isn't asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos. While millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there's something devious afoot are trying to block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data. As advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world's largest social network and search engine have sold users' viewing histories for advertising. The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn't against the law, even without your permission. If judges agree with Facebook and Google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person's image is used without permission -- big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions. A loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada.|2022-09-23 20:00:00|FAKE|Ava Murphy|City Beat|268905|56758|61|2480|Indonesia|English|2022-09-06 21:00:00|Análisis|1|True|1947600|482400|1243|1.0166666666666666

The former Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress Energizer because of the way Bill always perked up and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Energizer, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees. Bill Secret Service name is reportedly Eagle and is Evergreen. The Secret Service may have run out of E codenames over the years thanks to all of lady friends.

In other words, not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, We are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think a credible news organization. You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP even fire Tucker for this admission. probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? It all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.) not just AP, either. the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America: all liars and crooks, and all working for Hillary Clinton, the serial killer and rape excuser.

It was a strong guy, a big guy, Hough said, referencing his broken door. I have been able to kick that out. Grabbing his revolver, Hough took up a defensive position at the top of the stairs and waited until he saw the man who had broken into his home. I knew pretty much where he was, he explained. He came across my dining room and to the foot of my stairway. I had a revolver and fired at him twice. Though he hit the burglar with his two shots, they were more than enough to send the punk scrambling back out the broken glass door and away from what turned out to be a well-defended home. I missed, obviously, but I think I scared him, Hough added, pointing to the bullet holes in his wall. He certainly expect to see me.

8870|8 POINTS VANISH IN 4 DAYS|"Home POLITICS | US NEWS 8 POINTS VANISH IN 4 DAYS 8 POINTS VANISH IN 4 DAYS 0 SHARES [10/28/16] Donald Trump has gained on Hillary Clinton during the past week, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll , solidifying support among core Republican groups as well as political independents. Roughly 6 in 10 still expect Clinton to prevail, while the poll finds shrinking concerns about the accuracy of the vote count and voter fraud in the election. Clinton holds a slight 48-44 percent edge over Trump among likely voters, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 4 percent and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 1 percent in the survey completed Sunday through Wednesday. Clinton held a six-point edge in the previous wave and a 12-point edge in the first wave of the tracking poll by ABC News Sunday (50 percent Clinton vs. 38 percent Trump). In a two-candidate contest, Clinton holds a five-point edge over Trump, 50 to 45 percent. growth in support from 38 percent to 44 percent is fueled by shored-up support among Republican-leaning voting groups as well as a significant boost among political independents. Trump has made up ground among whites, particularly those without college degrees and women. Trump now leads by a 30 percentage point margin among white voters without college degrees, up from 20 points from this weekend. White women now tilt toward Trump by 48 to 43 percent after leaning 49 to 43 percent in favor before. Trump saw his biggest gains among political independents, favoring Trump by a 12-point margin in the latest tracking poll, 49 to 37 percent, after giving Clinton a narrow edge in late last week. Neither candidate has maintained a consistent lead among independent likely voters in Post-ABC polling this fall.

8903|News: Shaking Up Washington: Donald Trump Just Appointed A Cloaked Man As Secretary Of The Hook|Email Time to say goodbye to politics as usual. In another stunning game changer that has further upended the political establishment, President-elect Donald Trump this morning announced the nomination of a mysterious cloaked man to serve as his secretary of the Hook. Yep. Trump promised change, and right away appointing a nameless robed man to lead the Department of the Hook. that for a shock to the system? The silent man, whose face is completely shrouded within a thick, hooded cloak, is rumored to have topped the shortlist of candidates for secretary of the Hook after emerging alone from a dense forest at night and immediately causing all greenery within the Washington beltway to wilt. Trump has already lauded his nominee as a wonderful man with an absolutely tremendous cloak whom he trusts do an unbelievable job discharging the duties of the position, which include abiding by the Hook, interpreting the Covenant of the Hook, and holding aloft the candle whose flame subtracts light from its surroundings. The man in the cloak is going to be a fantastic secretary of the Hook. Just fantastic, said Trump, who added that the secretary will be second in the presidential line of succession. No one is better qualified to enforce the covenant than this man. His cloak is dark, he was born before Christ, I know his name, he has the Hook now, and ready to fight for us! And look now, but the presumptive secretary of the Hook is already making waves. At dawn this morning, he led the Zealots of the Hook in a procession through the streets of Washington, toward the open entrance to the Onyx Pyramid, an edifice by the Lincoln Memorial that residents could not remember ever having existed but that the cloaked man assured Americans in a terse press release has always been and shall forever be. One for sure: This appointment signals a whole new political era in the capital. We wait to see how this bold move turns out!|2022-09-17 04:00:00|FAKE|Ethan Hayes|The Insight|663587|13561|209|1956|Ukraine|English|2022-09-16 12:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1314000|1371600|1933|3.4833333333333334

8906|Huffington Post Continues Campaigning for Hillary Clinton|They pretend win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy or billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). However, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: win was overwhelmingly driven by repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye , all being proponents of building war against Russia such as : To confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, also very much and demonstrably not merely in words a real problem about Hillary too (and one that outside the context of the Presidential campaign has even been courageously reported by some of own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend reason to believe that actions would be even worse than hers have been, and readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Fox The aristocracy ( all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition the public (of all parties). And what a close look at the evidence shows explains win not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that mainly a problem so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it. the Big Lie, which Obama and the Clintons and Huffington Post promote and get paid very well to promote.

The UN has been voting overwhelmingly against the embargo for decades, but it is only in the past year that President Obama has started to criticize the embargo himself, and has sought to ease a lot of the long-standing restrictions on the island nation. The matter is hugely politically contentious within the US, however, with many in the Republican Congress condemning the White House for easing the restrictions, and the Congressional leadership so far preventing any more easing of the restrictions on commerce. The UN resolution itself is non-binding, and the real significance is not that it passed, but rather that the US abstained, which while reflecting the position is unusual, as it criticizes the US Congress internationally.|2022-09-21 22:00:00|FAKE|Maxwell Rivera|City Times|599282|94279|166|6397|Philippines|English|2022-09-12 01:00:00|Columna de humor|1|True|1782000|928800|1005|2.7666666666666666

Additionally, the present study establishes male-female ability ratios in a sample of over 7000 7th grade students in the right tail from 2011 to 2015 in India. Results indicate that ratios in the extreme right tail of math ability in the U.S. have shrunk in the last 20 years (still favoring males) and remained relatively stable in the verbal domain (still favoring females).

And I need to vote against Hillary. I need to vote against the media. Hunter noted the extreme bias exhibited by the media who refused to fact-check Clinton at the last debate, and what he sees as the difference between what a Trump and a Clinton presidency would look like: A Trump administration at least will include people I trust in positions that matter. I know if they will be able to hold him completely in check, but I know a Clinton administration will include people who have been her co-conspirators in corruption, and there even be a media to hold her accountable. Although Hunter want to tell NeverTrumpers how they should vote, he asked them to think about how important it is to keep Clinton out of office: not saying you should support him, but you lose sight of the importance of opposing her. If, or when, Hillary Clinton takes the oath of office, she needs to have as little support as possible. Frankly, she needs to be damaged. The mainstream media do it; in on it. A simple protest vote for a third party or a write-in of my favorite comic book character might feel good for a moment. It might even give me a sense of moral superiority that lasts until her first executive order damaging something I hold dear or her first Supreme Court nominee. But the sting that will follow will far outlive that temporary satisfaction. I oppose much of what Donald Trump has said, but I oppose everything Hillary Clinton has done and wants to do. And what someone says, no matter how objectionable, is less important than what someone does, especially when so objectionable. A personal moral victory suffice when the stakes are so high. As such, I am compelled to vote against Hillary by voting for the only candidate with any chance whatsoever of beating her Donald Trump.|2022-09-18 12:00:00|FAKE|Emily Parker|Press Pulse|144394|89577|460|9081|United Kingdom|English|2022-09-14 07:00:00|Crónica|0|True|1123200|1486800|1992|7.666666666666667

The materials include an e-mail from Trump to ""Carlos Danger,"" the on-line pseudonym which Weiner used, in which Trump bragged about groping then-Senator Clinton when she and former President Bill Clinton attended Trump's third wedding, to Melania Trump, at the billionaire's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2005.

It comes at a curious time, given the ongoing election. When asked about the timing, State Department spokesman John Kirby insisted that its purpose is to talk to researchers and scientists largely about climate change research. A reporter responded by questioning the legitimacy of the trip, noting, some criticism that this trip is basically, you know, the Secretary wants to knock Antarctica off his bucket list and doing it on taxpayer expense. Kirby insisted that it is important for Kerry to see firsthand what we are learning about the environment down there on the South Pole. As an individual who has literally championed climate change research and awareness for decades now, the secretary is and will remain committed to increasing the awareness and education of the public about this, Kirby said. The location of trip is also interesting. Russian scientists drew criticism in 2012 for drilling into Alien Lake Vostok, which scientists claim went undisturbed by sunlight for over 15 million years.

897|Poll: Trump Reaches 50 Percent Support Nationally for the First Time|"Donald Trump has reached 50 percent support from Republicans and Republican-leaners nationally for the first time since the beginning of the NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll in late December. This milestone is significant as the 2016 primary heads into its final few weeks of contests, as there has been intense speculation that Trump's support has a ceiling. Though his support has hovered in the high 40s since mid-March, the front-runner had yet to secure half of Republican voters. These results are according to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll conducted online from April 18 to April 24 of 10,707 adults aged 18 and over, including 9,405 registered voters. Support for Trump among most demographic groups has remained consistent in this week's tracking poll compared to previous weeks. However, when just looking at Republicans, excluding independents who lean toward the Republican Party, he now enjoys 49 percent support compared to 43 percent last week. This 6-point gain is important, as Trump usually does well among independents, but has struggled to win over more traditional Republicans so far. Support for both John Kasich (15 percent) and Ted Cruz (28 percent) is down among Republicans compared to the past few weeks. This traction among those who identify as belonging to the Republican Party will be significant as the Republican primary heads into closed primary races in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware Tuesday. Rhode Island utilizes a hybrid primary in which only those who are registered as unaffiliated can vote in either party's primary. Overall, this week's 6-point swing Trump up 4 points, Cruz and Kasich down 2 points is the biggest weekly shift in the poll so far. Combined with his significant win in New York, Trump's rise nationally could be an early sign of consolidation within the Republican Party. The NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll was conducted online April 18 through April 24, 2016 among a national sample of 10,707 adults aged 18 and over, including 9,405 who say they are registered to vote. Respondents for this non-probability survey were selected from the nearly three million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Results have an error estimate of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.

8974|The Left Turns on Bob Dylan for His Pro-Israel Views, Refusal to Acknowledge Nobel Prize|The Left Turns on Bob Dylan for His Pro-Israel Views, Refusal to Acknowledge Nobel Prize Oct 28, 2016 Previous post So Bob Dylan has won the Nobel Prize for Literature for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition. His name is now enshrined among a list of laureates that includes luminaries like T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. a tremendous honor for the legendary singer-songwriter, for sure. But also stirred up its share of controversy. I debate leave that to my esteemed colleagues Andrew Klavan and Ron Radosh to say two quick things. First, when the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to people like Yasser Arafat and Barack Obama, did it dim the luster of the prizes in other categories? And second, I like the idea of songs like Gotta Serve Somebody and Saved (and, apologies to Andrew, even It Me, Babe) joining the pantheon of Nobel Prize-winning literature. But now that the reliably left-leaning Nobel Prize Committee has given Dylan an award, a funny thing has happened. The left has begun to turn on Dylan for being less than the predictable leftist they have expected him to be. In Defense of Bob Nobel Prize for Deserves it! The first example comes to us from that cherished source of unbiased news, Al Jazeera. In a recent editorial , French sociologist and media critic Ali Saad takes the media to task for reporting the news of Bob award without mentioning that supports Israel. Saad gripes that: outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed. Saad goes on to cite Neighborhood Bully, an early tune from Dylan that expresses support for the nation of Israel. The song, that Stephen Holden described in The New York Times in 1983 as an outspoken defence of Israel , begins by stating two key precepts emphasising the Israeli perspective: first by comparing Israel to a man in exile whose enemies unjustly claim on their land, a sentence that serves as a scolding to those who refute the legitimacy of historic claim to land. Then, by metaphorically presenting Israel as a man outnumbered by a million to one, which postulates the frequent representation of Israel as the underdog of the Middle East.Such a stance by an anti-war activist raises serious doubts over commitment to humanity FOR ENTIRE ARTICLE CLICK LINK|2022-09-27 22:00:00|FAKE|Aria Shah|The Chronicle|834104|71906|146|5587|DR Congo|English|2022-09-09 07:00:00|Noticia destacada|1|True|2300400|691200|2454|2.433333333333333
8983|First Ever Hindu Woman Elected into Congress|First ever Hindu was elected to the US House of Representatives. She will take the oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita. During election, Hawaii elected Japan-born Mazie Hirono to be the first ever Asian-American woman elected to the Senate. Hawaii also elected Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as the first ever practicing Hindu to the US House of Representatives. Because of this, Fox News have declare Hawaii a disaster zone. Gabbard is the daughter of two conservative Hawaii politicians. She first ran, and was elected into office at the age of 21. After her first term, she served on a 12 month tour of duty with National Guard, and then became the first woman in history of the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy to be designated a distinguished honor graduate. She was then deployed to Baghdad as a medical operations specialist in 2004, and she was deployed to Kuwait in 2008. History has proven that not everyone is comfortable with a Hindu elect. When Hindu statesman Rajan Zed was asked by the Senate to open with a prayer in 2007, the American Family Association called the prayer gross idolatry and urged people to protest. Three protesters interrupted the prayer with shouts from the gallery. When she is sworn this January, Gabbard will take her oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text for Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma. Gabbard hopes to assist the US in fostering a better relationship with India, the largest democracy with a growing economic and nuclear power. She also hopes to work on affairs, and environmental issues. Other non-Christian people in Congress include Keith Ellison, who took his oath of office over the Qu-ran.

8987|Russia And NATO Engage In One Of The Largest Military Build-Ups Since The Cold War|DAILY CALLER 330,000 Russian troops amassing along European borders. NATO will contribute a 4,000-strong force to bolster the defenses of its members in the Baltic states and eastern Europe. Four battle groups will be created out of forces by early next year. The battle groups will be bolstered by a 40,000-strong reaction force, and various reinforcements as needed. The plan is the fulfillment of a promise to increase the defenses of former Soviet-bloc members under threat from Russian aggression. This month alone, Russia is deploying nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad and suspending a weapons-grade plutonium agreement with the United States, said Stoltenberg Wednesday while attending a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium. The deployment of the missiles to Kaliningrad, a small Russian satellite territory located between Poland and Lithuania, puts Poland and the Baltic states directly in sights. U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a battalion of 900 battle-ready soldiers will be deployed to eastern Poland as part of the new commitment. British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said his country will be sending a battalion of 800 soldiers to Estonia, in addition to a contingent of Typhoon fighter aircraft to Romania. Canada plans to send 450 troops to Latvia, backed by 140 Italians. Germany will contribute 400 to 600 troops to Lithuania. Russia steadily built up its military presence on the European border for several months. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced a plan to recruit 30,000 additional forces to be stationed on eastern flank in May, followed by the deployment of the Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad in early October. The massive military build-up represents one of the largest since the Cold War, and comes at a time when tensions between the West and Moscow at are dangerously tense.

Elected in 2012 in a UN-mandated vote in which no opposition was allowed, Hadi was supposed to serve two years in office leading to a new constitution and free elections. The constitution never happened, and Hadi extended his reign unilaterally in 2014. He resigned in January 2015 when his anti-Houthi military offensive turned sour and he lost the capital. The Saudis, primarily opposed to the Houthis because insists to this day that Hadi remains the rightful ruler, and in March 2015 attacked Yemen, vowing to reinstall him. While the Houthis have expressed openness to a unity government that ends the conflict, also opposed it involving Hadi or his vice president Ali Mushin Ahmar, who they say were too corrupt to work with in a transitional government. The UN plan seems largely to agree, as it would require Ahmar to resign outright, and would allow Hadi to remain only as a figurehead with no real power, instead seeking to stack the government with people both sides are likely to accept. The decision to leave Hadi in at all appears to be designed to placate the Saudis, who vowed to reinstall him through their war, and would be able to claim that they succeeded under this deal, even if it ultimately means Hadi get any power.

9|Planned Parenthood’s lobbying effort; pay raises for federal workers; and the future Fed rates|PLANNED LOBBYING GETS AGGRESSIVE. Congress may have spent August away from Washington but Planned campaign to convince lawmakers to protect the funding followed them back to their home states. Power Post has more. Lawmakers will raise the stakes when Congress returns next week by threatening to defund the group through the federal appropriations process. Planned counter-offensive is widespread and varied and is unfolding inside and outside the Beltway. The group has been organizing rallies, flooding town hall meetings, commissioning polls, shelling out six figures for television ads and hiring forensics experts to try to discredit undercover video footage that sparked the controversy. The success of these lobbying efforts will be tested when Congress returns and must move a short-term spending bill to keep the government open. Some conservatives in both chambers are pushing to defund Planned Parenthood, even if a standoff with Democrats leads to a government shutdown. FEDERAL WORKERS EXPECTED TO GET A PAY HIKE IN JANUARY. The stalled appropriations process in Congress means uncertainty for federal agencies and their workers but the White House waiting around for lawmakers to decide the fate of federal worker pay. Federal Eric Yoder reports that President Obama sent a letter on Friday detailing plans for a 1.3 percent pay raise for federal workers. It prevents what would be a much higher raise from being paid under the complex laws governing federal pay raises should no raise number be enacted into law by the end of the year. Congress could yet set a different figure, but the appropriations bills for 2016 so far have been silent on a raise. That continues a pattern that resulted in 1 percent raises being paid by default in January 2014 and 2015. RATE HIKE AT THE FED STILL LIKELY. Speculation has been rampant in recent months over when the Federal Reserve will increase U.S. interest rates and the Wall Street Journal reports that all signs still point to a rate increase this year. Inside the Fed, advocates for holding off a rate boost beyond this year getting much traction. In Jackson Hole, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota was an isolated voice among officials for sustaining near-zero interest rates. He has lost his share of battles over policy, including the decision last October to end the bond-buying program.|2022-09-22 09:00:00|REAL|Sin autor|Daily Digest|213438|69771|528|552|Turkey|English|2022-09-14 19:00:00|Noticia local|1|True|1166400|1821600|2365|8.8
9001|Small Stocks Threaten Breakdown – Can They Hang On?|Small Stocks Threaten Breakdown Can They Hang On? by IWB · October 27, 2016 by Dana Lyons The Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index has violated (for now) the 2 key uptrend lines that we recently identified. A main theme recently among both our posts and our quantitative risk analysis has been the battle between weakening market internals and resilient price averages. Despite deteriorating breadth and momentum, most of the major averages had been able to hold above the key levels that identified. For example, just 9 days ago , we highlighted 2 Up trendlines on the chart of the Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index (RUT). These lines (e.g., the post-2009 and post-February Up trendlnes), we suggested, were the key in determining whether the RUT would maintain its upward trajectory (above the lines), or see an expansion in potential downside. Recently, the RUT had been able (barely) to hold the top side of of the trendlines and maintain its path of least resistance to the upside. That path may have shifted today. As these updated charts show, the RUT closed below the 2 key trendlines today albeit by a fairly slim margin. Wide Angle: Close-Up: While the winds may have potentially shifted following action, the overall message here is the same as it was 9 days ago. Thus, we will repeat what we stated in that post: If the RUT should Continue to hold above the trendlines, the bulls will remain in control and the intermediate-term rally in small-cap stocks can persist further. Should the level give way, however, the bears may have their chance to finally deliver a more serious blow. Absent a quick recovery of the broken trendlines, the bears would appear to have their chance now, especially given the elevated status of our broad market risk assessment. The question is will they finally follow through, or will the small stocks manage to narrowly hang on once again?|2022-09-22 19:00:00|FAKE|Ethan Hayes|Sunrise Chronicle|578262|20726|134|281|Italy|English|2022-09-21 14:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|1857600|1753200|1869|2.2333333333333334

By Amanda Froelich Intriguing eco-friendly innovations are unveiled all the time, but the floating Jellyfish Lodge is probably unlike anything ever seen before. In addition to being aesthetically appealing, the lodges can purify the land, air, and water and grow nourishing food. Designer Janine Hung relays that the structures combine trash-collecting tentacles, aquaponic gardens, and a filtration system that all work to benefit the environment. The solar-powered lodges utilize aquaponic technology to grow fruits and vegetables while cleaning the air with an electrostatic system. Each structure features and interior garden that thrives by filtering polluted water. Additionally, long tentacle arms which appear similar to a collect drifting trash without harming wildlife. Unfortunately, not likely this design will be realized, as it only received an Honorable Mention award in this Biodesign Competition , reports Inhabitat . However, so neat we figured the concept needed to be shared. An intriguing feature of the lodge is that it can test water for toxicity and start the process of treating water through a unique microbial digestion chamber. Once the water is purified, it can be returned to the surrounding environment. If these structures are eventually created, ideally be maintained by nearby residents who could utilize the foods in their holistic kitchens .

Dancing about the place, proposing to every girl who walks past him and then laughing when they walk off. But today just sat there looking bloody depressed. I wonder why in such a mood? Usually give him a cup of coffee and a bit of cake for being so entertaining but if going to just sit there looking like he wants to cry then he can sod off. When asked why he was so down, McKay simply shook his head, muttered something about the government and then looked off down the street with a heavy sigh. Cook added: See. funny about that?

9029|New Yorkers fight to overturn ballot selfie ban|New Yorkers fight to overturn ballot selfie ban New Yorkers fight to overturn ballot selfie ban By 0 119 New York voters are suing the state, arguing it is unconstitutional to ban them from showing their completed ballots to others via social media. The ballot selfie ban is becoming a hot topic this election, affecting even celebrities like Justin Timberlake. The three New Yorkers Eve Silber, Rebecca White, and Michael Emperor filed the federal lawsuit in on Wednesday, seeking a judge to declare the election law banning ballot selfies unconstitutional, according to the attorney representing the group. Taking a photograph of a filled out ballot is a powerful political statement that demonstrates the importance of voting. Without the photograph, the message loses its power, says the lawsuit, filed by lawyer Leo Glickman in Manhattan Federal Court, according to the New York Daily News. Under the current state law, showing a marked ballot to another voter is considered a misdemeanor which can result in prison time and a hefty $1,000 fine, according to court papers. Glickman is seeking a court injunction to stop officials from enforcing the law before the November 8 election. Similar laws against ballot selfies have been struck down in Michigan, Indiana and New Hamsphire as a violation of the First Amendment guarantee of the freedom of speech. Selfies are being allowed at the polls in Connecticut, but officials will be watching for whether the practice becomes disruptive for voters. In New Jersey, Assemblyman Raj Mukherji is pushing for a bill that would protect right to take selfies at the ballot box, CBS radio reported. Singer-actor Justin Timberlake got into some trouble this week after posting a photo of himself voting in Tennessee on his Instagram page. The picture prompted a reminder of the law from state officials that such photography is against the law. Timberlake addressed the controversy during an appearance on Tonight Wednesday, telling host Jimmy Fallon he thought he was inspiring people with the picture and had no idea it was illegal. Taking photos inside a voting booth is illegal in Tennessee under a 2015 state law, as it is in 17 other states, according to a review of laws banning ballot selfies conducted by the Associated Press.

James interference in the presidential election has motivated Clinton supporters to work harder, give more money, and get to the polls, which in not what Republicans wanted at all. Democrats have seen through letter and the Republican spin. The October surprise has failed. Instead, it has made Hillary Clinton even stronger while giving her campaign more resources to use to close out the presidential election.

9056|"2 Reminders to Ignore the ""Trump is Doomed"" Polls"|"2 Reminders to Ignore the ""Trump is Doomed"" Polls We've recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the ""Trump is Doomed"" polling saga. A few days ago, the media was loudly trumpeting that Hillary's victory was inevitable, that the polls were in and she was going to ignore Trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races. And then, just like last time around, the numbers turned around again. I was recently asked to predict the race. I answered that the one thing I could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for Hillary right before the election. That much is very likely. It's in the media's interest to spread FUD by promoting polls that predict not just a Hillary win, but a landslide, creating the perception that voting is useless. The more Republicans feel that the outcome is futile, the less likely they will be to go out and vote. But the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding. This remains a challenging and very unusual election. The premature panic we've seen in some circles is unhealthy. We shouldn't completely ignore poll numbers, but neither should we treat them as inevitable. We've had two major lessons in why that's short sighted."|2022-10-06 20:00:00|FAKE|Ava Murphy|Daily Digest|504813|97158|397|285|Myanmar|English|2022-09-18 12:00:00|Reportaje|1|True|3070800|1486800|1221|6.616666666666666

Bumping into each other as they both sought to post a letter, presumably of complaint, at their local postbox, Dunphy and Hook found themselves politely disagreeing on who is the more controversial figure. This polite exchange remained reasonable for just 2.46 seconds before both men began trading exaggerated claims and quips, in an effort to both convey they were the proud owners of the most contrary opinions. No. No. No! You merely despise joyful faces when they eat ice-cream. I hate the little shits with every essence of my being. clumsy, careless, a cod, a fraud, Dunphy barked at Hook after the Newstalk radio host and rugby pundit suggested children were just the worst. In a desperate bid to one up his contrary counterpart, eyes frantically searched the street around him for something to give out about. Cars, too noisy. Roads! Some have potholes. The sky, too bloody high for my liking. Dunphy, I bloody hate that crevasse-faced tosser, Hook bellowed as he commented on one thing after another, trying to cement his reputation as a controversial champion of Ireland. The pair were then forcibly removed from the street by passers by who take much more of their droning, placing them in a room together, which has been rented especially for the broadcasters for the next month. With the stalemate continuing into its 12th hour both men are aware they could secure victory by mentioning how Hitler made the trains run on time, but neither seem ready to share the opinion just yet.|2022-09-23 11:00:00|FAKE|Amelia Rivera|Capital Gazette|63036|44957|171|4812|Ethiopia|English|2022-09-10 21:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|828000|1915200|1673|2.85

Terrifying CCTV footage from outside the Toulouse club shows Amine Britel suddenly being engulfed by flames as he chats to fellow smokers. Two men rush to his aid, frantically attempting to put out the fire while Britel leaps about in panic. Moments earlier, he could be seen vaping on the e-cigarette before placing it back in his trouser pocket. While the flames were brought under control within a matter of seconds, Britel was left with significant burns to his hand and hip area I heard what sounded like a firecracker but ten times louder, he said of the incident which occurred in late October. After the shock of the explosion, I realized I had caught on fire. He believes the hot battery came into contact with coins in his pocket and the resulting sparks caused the explosion. Though the name of the manufacturer has not been disclosed, Britel confirmed he has reported the incident to the China-based firm. The Toulouse case is the latest in a string of serious incidents involving e-cigarettes in recent years. In February 2016 a woman in Bayonne suffered burns when the device she was using suddenly caught fire inside her car. The flames went on to engulf and destroy three other nearby vehicles. In 2014 a man in Merseyside, England died when the e-cigarette charging in his bedroom exploded, igniting the oxygen concentrator he was using. Earlier this year a 19-year-old man working at a California convenience store was treated for burns when the e-cigarette he was carrying in his pocket exploded, propelled itself 15ft (6 meters) into the air and tore his pants to the knee. CCTV footage has also captured the moment a charging e-cigarette exploded right in the face of a barmaid in the UK in 2014.

But in an ends' motion what is it that I have made? More musing of a solid soul, a gasp of an angel brought forth upon the devils mask. Shattered within a hopeless contextual void of self dissolution. To dissolve in ones own thoughts of regard of high and mighty being? In the beginning what is it that we seek? In hell and high water, in times of disregard. What is it that seeks us. From times of happenstance to those of remorse. Again we beckon the call to purpose and resolve. Every time, even without a moments clarity we call too and forth of the void, to give us direction. Show me ways beyond vice, ways not wanted of founded living, shallower within such a world.

While Comey did not elaborate on what those emails contain, the director that the emails were discovered in connection with an unrelated case. Via FoxNews He told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete this additional work. Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made saying he hopes that is corrected.

British banker took 60g of cocaine while torturing & killing prostitute, court told By 0 137 British banker Rurik Jutting took up to 60 grams of cocaine while torturing and killing a prostitute, a Hong Kong court has heard. He is also alleged to have harbored fantasies of returning to the UK to kidnap and abuse teenage girls. The 30-year-old is on trial for the murder of two Indonesian women in his flat in the former British colony and finance hub. In a video seen by authorities, Jutting is heard bragging about the massive amount of cocaine he had taken over the course of the three-day torture of his first victim, 23-year-old Sumarti Ningsih. He told police he derived a sense of enjoyment he never had before from his actions and knew then that he would kill again. Read more Jutting, formerly a banker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who studied at the University of Cambridge, has denied murder but admitted to manslaughter. He was arrested in 2014 after the bodies of Ningsih and a second Indonesian woman, 26-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, were found in his apartment. Interview tapes played in the courtroom reveal some of thought processes during the killings. She was unlucky to be the person in my flat when I realized that physically hurting someone when under cocaine was something I gained satisfaction from, he said of his first victim. Medical experts told the court that Jutting appeared to have built up a huge tolerance to cocaine and existed on a daily dose of wine, cocaine and Red Bull. He also revealed his plans to return to the UK and abduct schoolgirls from an expensive boarding school in Buckinghamshire. They would be, say, 15 years old and I would basically turn these three girls into my sex slaves, it would be good to psychologically play them off against each other, he told police.

Most of the media ignored the groundbreaking presser today. They want Americans to know about this pro-Trump gay conservative from Silicon Valley. FOX Business Network carried much of the speech live. Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel took his pro-Trump message to the heart of the media establishment in a major speech at the National Press Club this morning. voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of this country to have failed, Thiel said to an audience of about 150 members of the press. The insiders have been getting it wrong for a long time, he added. Establishment politicians are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. During the Q&A session, the moderator inquired about social blowback Thiel has received for supporting Trump and dwelled heavily on funding of the Hulk Hogan case that brought down Gawker. Thiel justified funding the lawsuit against a Gawker that he described as a singular, sociopathic bully. Defending illegal revenge porn under the guise of the First Amendment is an insult to journalists, he noted. That comment aroused a scowl in the reporter sitting next to me, who walked out shortly after. The room was full of about 150 journalists, mostly from mainstream publications. There was a row of cameras filming the event, but only two reporters appeared to be streaming it live through Periscope and Facebook Live. National Press Club Executive Director William C. McCarren treated several members of the press brusquely as they tried to enter the event. The event highlighted the growing gulf between the establishment and the rest of the country, the mainstream press versus the independent press, and the truth of seen from direct sources and how mainstream reporters often spin it. At one point during the speech, Thiel directly pointed out the hoaxing and bias within the media. The Advocate, a magazine which once praised me as a published an article saying that as of now I am, and I quote, a gay because I agree with their politics. When a high-profile, highly intelligent figure like Thiel supports Trump, who cares about the truth?

According to Kenneth Meshoe, chairman of the African Christian Democratic Party faction, any attempt to compare experience in Israel with the former racist regime is offensive to individuals who suffered under the system of racial separation. Whatever challenges the Arab minority in Israel faces, the reality of life here cannot be compared to his experiences growing up, he insists. There is freedom of movement in this country that we never had in South Africa, Meshoe told Tazpit Press Service (TPS) during a visit to Jerusalem last week. Benches and bathrooms said We could never take transportation. Most white doctors would not treat black patients, only white ones. And those who were willing to treat black patients out of compassion many of them would ask the patients to enter their clinics through the back door so they be seen by the white patients in the lobby. I know if it was illegal for white doctors to treat black patients, but the reality was that very few did. According to Meshoe, Some South Africans who say apartheid in Israel are only repeating things heard from other people, not because actually seen it themselves. They are just perpetuating propaganda. Other people politicians are only thinking about their needs, and the statements that will serve their needs. They ask do I gain [by claiming there is or is not apartheid in Israel] and then make a decision. So they are perpetuating something that that they know very well is a lie. Meshoe said he first visited Israel several years after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994. He joined a church delegation to the Holy Land and used the opportunity both for a religious pilgrimage and a political education, but the latter came as a surprise.

Share on Twitter Print This Post The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. On the surface, the sudden revival of Hillary emails looks like an October surprise designed to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The problem with this theory is that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that Trump is toast. Unless Hillary emails say, LOL. I was the shooter on the grassy knoll, there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. In fact, the emails FBI Director was investigating did not come from Clinton or her server. They seem to have very little to do with Hillary Clinton or her presidential campaign. The emails are like catnip to Republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending Republicans to Congress, bring down a Democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival. For the next ten days, Republican Congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating Hillary Clinton. The Republican candidates can pretend like Trump exist because their new pitch to voters is, Vote for me and bring down Hillary. Donald Trump is a lost cause. Millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. Trump is being out organized and trounced by Clinton on the ground. To understand the real value of the email scandal to the Republican Party, look down the ballot.

Thanks to Wikileaks and the Intercept , in fact, we now have a list of no less than 65 mainstream reporters whose campaign coverage constitutes propaganda for the Clinton campaign and no wonder, considering the obscenely lopsided drivel presented by their outlets. As (actual) journalists Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang reported on October 9, the Intercept exclusively received documents obtained by the source known as Guccifer 2.0 evidencing Clinton campaign tactics to court journalists portraying the former secretary of state in a positive light. As these internal documents demonstrate, the Intercept reported , a central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated. At times, campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be Quote: d and what should be described as the One internal strategy document dated January 2015 months before Clinton officially kicked off her campaign in April with the curious heading Earned Media/Next Steps exposes how the campaign made an albeit infrequent practice of crafting supposed news pieces from beginning to completion.

I think that we have decided that rather than confront the disagreement and differences of opinion, just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with us, Thomas said. Unfortunately he is exactly right. Both Republicans and Democrats are guilty of preferring to demonize their opponents rather than engaging in meaningful discussion. This sort of polarization help America. All it does is increase the frustration the American people have with Congress when they see nothing happening for years.

9142|US/Russian Relations Sour Further As Putin Refuses To Open Snapchat From Obama|0 Add Comment IN the clearest indication yet that US/Russian relations may be at an all-time low post-Cold War, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is staunchly refusing to open a Snapchat he received from his US counterpart Barack Obama. If Putin opens it, a poor political play. It shows curious, interested in what Obama has to say. By not opening it, telling Obama and the world that he has something better to do with his time, explained app and politics expert Morgan Wilde. A number of Snapchat users have become heavily invested in the ongoing brinkmanship between the two superpowers who are locked in a series of countermeasures in Syria, which have left lives of innocent civilians in the balance and with rumours persisting that Putin looked at any Western Snapchat stories in weeks, the outlook is bleak. Oh, shit, I realise it was all this serious, said one Snapchat user, who had finally begun to understand the full extent of the deterioration of the diplomatic relationship. one thing to be squabbling over Aleppo, and accusations of war crimes, but it really hits home when played out on my favourite app, added Snapchat user Ciaran Bergin. However, some political commentators have urged people not to read too much into the exchange. Look, who knows what the Snap contained, it could have just been Obama with a dog face, his way of reaching out to Putin and saying lonely at the top, it? Now, how funny do I look with dog ears and a big not panic about this, shared commentator Henrietta Norris. There is some hope in Russia circles that Putin was simply taking a day off the app as sick of seeing the same 4 or 5 people send Snapchats all day long.|2022-09-12 01:00:00|FAKE|Maxwell Rivera|Voice of the Nation|873509|93597|497|3239|India|English|2022-09-10 02:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|928800|759600|1664|8.283333333333333
9143|Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs to Israel|Fragment of Old Tax Bill Meant to Undercut Muslims' Claim to Important Mosque by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This While the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a Muslim holy site of worship was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. And the Muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1,300 years, but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. Israeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam, was tantamount to denying absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people. The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory.

""While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,"" Carter, who is in Europe meeting with U.S. allies, said in a statement. ""This process has dragged on too long, for too many service members,"" he said. ""Too many cases have languished without action. That's unfair to service members and to taxpayers."" Last week the Los Angeles Times reported that about 10,000 California National Guard troops had been ordered to repay enlistment bonuses - some of more than $15,000 - that were improperly given to them. The newspaper said audits revealed the California Guard had overpaid troops in order to entice them to join and meet enlistment targets more than a decade ago. Senior Defense Department officials have been told to assess the bonus situation and establish a ""streamlined, centralized process"" by the start of next year, Carter said in the statement. ""The objective will be to complete the decision-making process on all cases as soon as possible - and no later than July 1,"" he said. The issue has caused outrage in Congress. Members from both parties have called on the Pentagon to drop efforts to reclaim the bonuses. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Fox News on Tuesday that if the Pentagon did not drop the effort to reclaim re-enlistment bonuses, lawmakers would move legislation on the issue.

They are all believed to be copies of a single original manuscript which is thought to have been written during the Third Dynasty of Ur by most historians, although some believe it might have been written even earlier. The best-preserved example of this ancient text is called the Weld-Blundell Prism and is on public display in the Ashmolean Museum. An ancient text tells of alien rulers of ancient Earth The Sumerian King Lists have baffled historians ever since they were uncovered by modern human beings. The text describes a fascinating period in history when beings referred to as gods ruled over humankind of tens of thousands of years. The manuscript makes reference to eight kings who from who ruled for an astonishingly long period of 241,200 years. Each of these deified kings met their end during the Great Flood which devastated the population of the world. After the flood, the text claims that another was lowered from and that these beings took up control of the people of Earth once again . For a long time, it has been believed that the stories of these incredibly long-lived kings, their eventual demise, and their replacement were simply the mythology of the ancient civilization who compiled the Sumerian King List. However, some have speculated that the text might not be mythology at all. The fact that the kings are said to have descended from heaven has led a few people to suggest that they might have been of an otherworldly origin. This would mean that their incredibly long reigns over the cities might be literal rather than metaphorical as these alien beings might have had much longer lifespans than human beings. They may have even been immortal. This article (Ancient Sumerian Writings Reveal The Earth Was Ruled By Eight Immortal Kings For 241,200 Years) is free and open source.

Yay! said racist, Simon Williams. What a great morning to be American like every morning, obviously, as every other nation is inferior. But this morning is just super-bloody-duper. The moment I saw the news I looked at my collection of Nazi-themed hats and said we are back in Because previously I was discouraged from wearing Nazi-themed hats, you see. PC gone mad, I tell you that. Reasonable conservative voter, Kevin Carmichael, said, it is a shame that we seem to attract the racists. I guess the risk you take when you run a campaign based on a simple fear of brown people, but hey, we got the votes, and we won, and all that matters. Yes, it is. You just watch. going to be great.

Is it possible that ISIS and al-Qaeda in Syria are being used -- or even supported -- by the US and its allies as a ""regime change"" weapon against Syria's Assad government? The US pursued this policy before, when it used Saudi-trained radicals to fight a Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan. Those radicals became al-Qaeda... Copyright © 2016 by RonPaul Institute.

The 83-year-old peer said that every member of inner circle was forced to take a life and steal something irreplaceable from close family to prove they were outside bourgeois morality. He continued: an idea I believe she took from Aleister Crowley. I decided to get both my trials over with at once and choked the dog with my bare hands. My mother never forgave me, of course, but I have to say it worked. From that moment on I had no sentimental respect for life, and human suffering was no longer any impediment to policy. Of course, I was still terribly upset by what she did to Westland. That poor helicopter company. Still brings tears, even now.

Podesta also agreed with a campaign suggestion to describe Abedin as an integral part of the team. The Wikileaks email exchange , dated July 2, 2015 and released on Tuesday, begins with press secretary Nicholas Merrill telling Milia Fisher, aide, that Politico has been working on a profile on Huma that we are being what call partially cooperative with. Merrill said after consulting with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri and Huma herself, the campaign decided to have the reporter sit down with Huma off the record. We think there is some value in demystifying her a bit in general, and Politico a bad place to do it, Merrill wrote to Fisher. Merrill asked Fisher to see if Podesta would be willing to weigh in, which I think would be good in the spirit of showing team unity. The piece will be about evolution from body person to senior staffer, so if up for it, maybe John could say something about her being a multi-faceted team player, Merrill wrote. Then he offered a suggested quotation: Like: I was there at the White House when Huma was a young intern, and now an integral part of the team. as multi-faceted as she is bright, and when you combine that with her humility, you ask for a better colleague. Merrill tells Fisher, Feel free to tweak that, put it in voice, or blow it up. Fisher forwarded email to Podesta, asking him if be willing to provide a quote. Comms (communications) thinks it might lend an air of community to the piece, she wrote to Podesta. reply: Change bright to and after humilty add strategic sense.' The complete email exchange, as provided by WikiLeaks, can be seen here : The July 2, 2015 Politico profile of Abedin described her as longest-serving aide. It said that like a mother monitoring her child on the playground, she never let Clinton drift out of her line of sight, ever vigilant and poised to act.

'You can go to University Center and they'll give you a ballot, a new ballot. They'll void your old ballot and give you a new ballot. And you can go out and make sure it gets in,' Trump claimed while speaking in Colorado. The case is that voters registered in Colorado get their ballots by mail. They also have right to demand a new one or vote in person at a polling station in case their previous ballot was not counted. Before that Trump claimed several times about imperfect election system of the US, which allows vote rigging. Last week the OSCE observers expressed their concern about fair voting while monitoring preparations for future elections, as there is 'a whole range of significant faults'. Head of the German OSCE observers Michael Georg Link stated that '6 million Americans are exempt from the vote'.

Via AlternativeNews It breaks down into, according to one paper, phenylalanine (50%), aspartic acid (40%) and methanol (10%) during metabolism in the body. The excess of phenylalanine blocks the transport of important amino acids to the brain contributing to reduced levels of dopamine and serotonin. Video Below Well put by another paper: Aspartame is a widely used artificial sweetener that has been linked to pediatric and adolescent migraines. Upon ingestion, aspartame is broken, converted, and oxidized into formaldehyde in various tissues. 5 academic papers are cited in this video, showing exactly what Aspartame does to the body, including one study that plays advocate, and honestly fails. Aspartame, as methanol can cause blindness, is linked to deterioration of vision, several cancers, and a litany of other ills.

It is managed by our Editorial Board Shiite militia says it is close to Tal Afar, which Turkey has warned is off limits By GPD on November 4, 2016 By Rudaw ERBIL, Kurdistan Region The Shiite-led Hashd al-Shaabi militia said Thursday that its forces are 15 kilometers from Tal Afar, a Turkmen town that Turkey has warned the militia to stay clear of. The Hashd al-Shaabi are continuously advancing and we are just 15 kilometers from Tal Afar and nearing the Mosul-Raqqa road, Karim Nuri, spokesperson of the Hashd al-Shaabi, told Rudaw. He said he hoped that in a few hours his forces will be in control of the Mosul-Raqqa road, a critical supply line for the two ISIS strongholds in Iraq and Syria. Nuri said the Iranian-backed Hashd had not received any air support from the coalition, which had from the outset opposed any role for the militia in the Mosul offensive. Tal Afar, north of Mosul city, is a predominantly Turkmen town that was captured by ISIS two years ago when the group captured large swathes of land in the north. Turkey has warned Hashd forces from entering Tal Afar, for fear the Shiite militia would brutalize the population, which is divided between Sunnis and Shiites. Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country opposed any Hashd presence in Tal Afar. Tal Afar is a very sensitive issue for us. We definitely do not regard it [Hashd involvement] positively in Tal Afar and Sinjar. I already told this to officials clearly, Erdogan said Saturday. Tal Afar is a totally Turkmen city, with half Shiite and half Sunni Muslims. We do not judge people by their religious affiliation, we regard them as Muslims, he added, But if Hashd al-Shaabi terrorizes the region, our response would be different.

Ah, ye trust that Eircode, a load of shite, confirmed a government spokesman, failing to be drawn on the fact the scheme was set up in such a way as to avoid bringing anyone to account for administering the non-consensual and often unnecessary surgeries to over 1,500 women. But listen, get onto An Post there and complain, we swear we sent it. This like all the other times we were just delaying giving women, many of whom are now in their 80s, their compensation for having their pelvises broken against their wishes by a medical professional working for the State, the spokesman added, full of compassion. Survivors have been relentlessly campaigning since the compensation scheme was first put in place, simply to access the money rightfully owed to them. Keen to remain in the public consciousness in order to force successive governments to honour their commitment and admonish them for so openly working against victims, many of the women have died in recent years without receiving any of the money they are entitled to after those administering the compensation scheme have demanded an unrealistic amount of paperwork. It is thought main opposition party Fianna Fáil would be in an ideal position to make an issue of the scandalous roadblocks and delays put in front of the women, however, the leader Micheál Martin stood over a number of delays when he was minister for health along with his successors in the position Mary Harney, James Reilly and Leo Varadkar. Honestly, this is a terrible misunderstanding, not trying to limit the liability and just drag this out until all the women have passed away, relying on the apathy to let us go unchallenged, not our style.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denounced the bomb attack, calling on authorities to speed up the rescue operation. Reports say some 500 people were in the shrine when the bomb went off. ""Every day, around sunset, there is a dhamaal (a Sufi ritual dance) here, and there are large numbers of people who come for this,"" said Nawaz Ali, the shrine's custodian.

It was one of the deadliest attacks on Pakistan's security forces in recent years.

The $6 billion request comes as an urgent request from the Pentagon, and would pay for additional ground troops in Iraq, the additional troops left in Afghanistan by stalling the drawdown, and to pay for escalated airstrikes around the world. Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord says the hope is to get the White House to approve submitting the request to Congress before next election, with an eye at getting it added to the latest emergency spending bill, expected before early December. These emergency funding bills are the main way to get around spending caps, with Congress deliberately funding the Pentagon only for a portion of the year with money that, by the reckoning, was the whole budget, then slipping emergency bills in afterwards to pay for the rest of the year, while pretending the caps still exist.|2022-09-30 23:00:00|FAKE|William Kumar|The Informer|224371|38459|93|3173|South Korea|English|2022-09-04 23:00:00|Reseña|0|True|316800|2563200|1107|1.55

Parker claimed a whole range of state organs and powers in Russia are being brought to bear against Britain and the US, claiming that the advent of cyberwarfare has increased the number of ways in which Russia can move against them. Parker went on to claim that Russia defines itself by opposition to the West and, despite being a covert threat for decades has been increasingly hostile, citing their operations in Ukraine and Syria as proof that they are acting to just spite the West. This has been a common western talking point, but in practice Western (read: US) policy in both Ukraine and Syria appears to have itself been built with an eye toward being on the opposite side from Russia in the first place, and Russia is then condemned for acting in their own interests. This was particularly glaring in Syria, where interest was obviously in the survival of a friendly Syrian government to host their naval base, and where countering Russia has brought the US anti-ISIS coalition into increasingly overt support for Nusra Front, simply because the ones most directly fighting against Russia.|2022-09-25 10:00:00|FAKE|Daniel Patel|Evening Echo|281906|25633|194|4524|Philippines|English|2022-09-16 02:00:00|Crítica|0|True|1278000|2084400|1458|3.2333333333333334

9236|Shocking Questions About the FBI & the ‘News’ Media|Posted on November 6, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse At 2:47 in this video about a key moment in the 7 September 2016 Town Hall between Trump and Clinton where Matt Lauer has asked her about her privatization of her State Department emails, Ms. Clinton says, but the real question is the handling of classified materials, which is I think what the implication of your question was. Lauer did not deny that; he was following the line of Comey, that only the classified emails could pose a criminal problem for her. However, that assumption is flat-out false, and both Hillary Clinton knows it (which is why she tried there to narrow the meaning of his question to the classified-information issue ), and also Comey knows it (which is why he has his FBI exclude from its consideration the illegality of her privatization of official email itself her theft of U.S. government information, her abuse of even non-confidential information, her destruction of evidence by destroying her government emails, etcetera there are several laws she broke which have nothing to do with confidential information, but both the FBI and the media (at least until about-face on October 28th) were ignoring them, and they still do ignore each one of them. Here are six of those laws . They describe what nobody denies that she did, and the maximum sentence under all of them, if the FBI were to throw the book at her, would be 72 years. Conviction of her under them would be a slam-dunk, but all of these laws are being simply ignored. So, the questions here are: Why is the FBI ignoring those criminal laws, which she clearly did violate? Why are media ignoring the ignoring these laws?|2022-09-30 09:00:00|FAKE|Isabella Nguyen|The Daily Dispatch|126821|54882|321|4487|Italy|English|2022-09-14 12:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|2512800|1141200|1668|5.35

9251|US abstains from UN vote calling for end to Cuban embargo|US abstains from UN vote calling for end to Cuban embargo US abstains from UN vote calling for end to Cuban embargo By 0 94 The US government abstained from the UN vote on a resolution calling for an end to the US economic embargo against Cuba, for the first time in 24 years. The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution with 191 votes in favor on Wednesday. The only other abstention, besides the US, was Israel. The vote is non-binding but it can have political weight. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described the abstention as a positive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba, according to Reuters. Rodriguez said in September that the embargo cost Cuba $4.6 billion last year, and the full damage over the length of the 50-year embargo was estimated at $125.9 billion. When it was first announced that the US government would abstain from the vote, the entire General Assembly applauded. Abstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government. We do not, Samantha Power the US Ambassador to the United Nations told the General Assembly on Tuesday. We are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people, she said, according to AP. The Obama administration began normalizing relations with the Communist-run country in at the end of 2014, easing trade and travel restrictions. On July 20, 2015, diplomatic relations were restored, and embassies in the two countries were reopened. Lifting the full embargo will take the support of the Republican-run Congress, which remains critical of the efforts, arguing it offered too many concessions to Cuba and accepted little in return, especially on human rights and the restoration of expropriated property. Obama made the first visit to Havana by a US president in 88 years in March. Via RT .

Many desperate people who are currently living in fear will not be as lucky as these deportees, confirmed political expert Conor Franken, outlining just how fortunate some illegal immigrants are.

Labeled as a ""strange thing"", a creature was swimming along the surface of the river but looked like no ordinary creature. Unique Creature Captured On Tape In Alaska As of now, it is being called an ice monster, though some have called it a variety of things. Some individuals think it is a huge eel, while others have indicated that it is simply a large fish. There has not been a further investigation by the individual and the company who spotted the monster, but they provided a very vague response and indicated that they would leave it up to the public to make the guesses and dictate whatever the creature is. The creature is unique in that it appears to be an incredibly light white color with a wiggly body, much like a fish. It seems to have a fin of some sort. However, it is extremely long. The length is equivalent to an adult rattlesnake. The visual features are vague in that only parts of its body can be seen during the recording. The head can not be seen, but the mid-section and rear areas of the body are slightly shown . It is very possible that it could be an eel as eels can reach extremely large lengths, though the average one is not of this length. The idea of it being a pike is a lot less likely because pike can grow to relatively long sizes, there is a very unlikely chance that a pike could possibility grow to the length and pike are not that bright white. Some are white with spots; however, they are not as noticeably white as the recording shows. Ultimately, it is still left to the public to guess what this unique creature is. It brings up an interesting question of why the employee nor the company would further look into what the creature was or why no one else has attempted to look more into the creature.

9307|Teenage Boy KNOCKS OUT His Classmate For Assaulting Their Female Teacher In The FACE- And It’s EPIC!|0 comments Not a lot of teenage boys would go out of their selfish ways to stand up for a teacher like this. He stood up for his teacher when his peer punched her in the face. This young man is certainly respectable! A shocking video has emerged showing the moment a protective student knocked out a classmate who had just attacked their female teacher. The footage shows that the teacher was trying to break up a fight between two students one in a red hoodie and one in a black hoodie when the boy in the red turns around and hits her in the face. The teacher, dressed in white and wearing glasses, appears to fall to the ground after being hit, and then leaves the classroom. Then, a third student comes in and punches the boy in head, sending him straight down to the ground. The third student is heard saying: the out, you just hit the fucking He then adds: your you just hit the teacher, you do that. Who the do you think you The teacher then reappears in the room, and appears relatively unscathed. She tells the group to stop fighting and just hit you, not says the boy that came to her not the teacher replies. It is unclear where the video was filmed or what school was involved, however the clip was spreading quickly on social media on Wednesday after appearing on the website LiveLeak. Some viewers questioned whether the boy in red may have mistakenly hit the teacher, believing she were the other one of the students. However others said he clearly meant to hit the woman. Shout out to the boy for standing up for what is right!

9308|Putin’s Adviser Takes Credit For Trump Victory: ‘Maybe We Helped A Bit With Wikileaks’|Donald shocking presidential win last night has left most of the world in mortified awe, but one leader seems especially pleased by the upset, perhaps because he had something to do with it. Just hours after Trump took the stage to deliver his acceptance speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated the president-elect on his win. It was only three weeks ago, at the third presidential debate that Hillary Clinton said Trump would be puppet and it looks like Putin is eager to take on the role. Speaking from the Kremlin, Putin specifically praised Trump on his vow to restore relations with Russia: We understand the way to that will be difficult, taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the US and Russia. As I have repeatedly said, that is not our fault that Russia-US relations are in that state. Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully-fledged relations with the US. I repeat we understand this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part in it. And what part will Trump play? Ask Sergei Markov. The pro-Kremlin political analyst, who was equally thrilled by the election outcome, is confident Trump will have America do a 180 on the Syrian debacle and join Russia in its backing of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. There is every reason to believe the analyst, too. At the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Hillary Clinton joked that Trump was healthy as a horse you know the one Vladimir Putin rides It looks like she might be right. Trump has always seemed a bit cozy with the Russian president , but now he may actually owe him a debt of gratitude for the part in his win. In relation to Russian interference in the election, Markov said, Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks. Up until now the Kremlin has denied any involvement; Putin calling The Obama accusations they hacked Democratic Party emails, then leaking them to WikiLeaks, as nonsense claims. Markov did admit it might not be all smooth riding, adding, Putin is a macho, Trump is also a macho. Maybe it could be a problem. Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of liberal Echo of Moscow radio, agrees: Putin like unpredictability and Trump is the definition of unpredictability. I guess we will just have to see who will be riding whom.

9309|Neil Armstrong: Their Ships Were Far Superior To Our -Boy, Where They Big|Everyone is familiar with the broadcast images of Neil Armstrong's historic first steps on the moon, and many believe his footsteps to be the first ever on the lunar surface. However, during a documented NASA symposium, Armstrong made comments alluding to the fact that not only had other species visited the moon, but that there were signs of colonization there upon. The Real Reason NASA Refuses a Return to the Moon Armstrong stated in an interview with an unnamed professor at the symposium that their presence on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission was immediately noticed and addressed by an alien race. The beings that occupied the lunar air space made very clear their displeasure of the human's arrival on the moon's surface: Armstrong: It was incredible of course, we had always known there was a possibility the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questions then of a space station or a moon city. Professor: How do you mean warned off? Armstrong: I go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology Boy, where they big! and menacing No, there is no question of a space station . Armstrong: Naturally NASA was committed at that time, and risk a panic on But it really was a quick scoop and back again. (Above Top Secret, p. 186) Additionally, there are reports that upon arrival on the moon Armstrong witnessed structures on the surface resembling shops and other buildings obviously not designed by man. It is believed that while footage exists of these findings, the decision was made not to make these films public so as to not incite public panic. WATCH THE VIDEO: NASA's unwillingness to move forward with lunar cities or even stations can easily be explained by the fear of going against the will of a much more advanced race. Armstrong stated that this fear is what lead to the following Apollo missions to only include a quick landing and sample collection. With this limited access to the moon, NASA or any other space exploration organization would be greatly hindered in their efforts to establish surface space stations of any type and lunar colonies would be completely infeasible. Could it be that human's exploration of the cosmos is closely regulated by alien races? What lengths would those races go to prevent space travel advancement by humans? Perhaps in the future, humans will gain the favor of the celestial inhabitants and be privy to the mysteries of beyond.

Staffan de Mistura said, in a statement, the U-N has credible reports civilians have been killed in the attacks. De Misutra blamed the militants for the attacks, calling them relentless and indiscriminate. His reaction came after at least seven civilians, including three children died in Aleppo as a result of the shelling. Syrian media say several were also wounded amid relentless shelling by terrorists on civilian targets in Western Aleppo. Foreign-backed terrorists have stepped up attacks across Aleppo, bringing the total number of civilians killed in the past two days to over 40. The Syrian observatory for Human Rights confirmed 14 children are among the dead and another 250 civilians have been wounded in the terrorist shelling. Fighting has stepped up in Aleppo, with around 15 hundred terrorists massing around the western edges of the flashpoint city. Government forces and allied fighters have successfully managed to foil any advance by the terrorists.

9335|British PM Refuses To Withdraw Support For Saudi Arabia|Posted on October 27, 2016 by Carol Adl in News // 0 Comments The British Prime Minister has refused to withdraw her support for UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Theresa May also refused to withdraw support for Saudi place on the UN Human Rights Council despite the Kingdoms atrocities in Yemen. During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn confronted May over Saudi violations and called for an end to the weapons sales (see video below) Press TV reports: The issues are being We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen, May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. Corbyn also questioned support for Saudi membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month. London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than £3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000. Rights groups have also condemned the crackdown on dissent and prosecution of pro-reform activists.|2022-09-30 08:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|Morning Star|633345|72412|515|3902|France|English|2022-09-06 11:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|2509200|446400|1679|8.583333333333334

WWN carried out some extensive research to discover not all teachers fit the lazy stereotype and are actually making the most of their time off. 5 things doing that result in them ending up face down in a pool of their own vomit while haphazardly correcting your love my Mammy essay. 1) Pre-Session even try to class this as a balls to the wall session. It Do not misunderstand the situation. A pre-session is no more a session than the Pope is a Muslim. So try and pull a fast one on teachers. Sure it be a session, no drugs in sight, trust us, we looked. 2) Just the one Just going for the one is simply that, an expression of a desire to have a casual catch up with a fellow teacher friend without being unfairly labelled a basket case that go two minutes without recreating their favourite scenes from Trainspotting. And still the if an early house, after ambling home from last pre-session. 3) Correcting essays See, not all fun and games and importing four tonnes of class A drugs. Teachers have some serious work to do, and a bottle of wine and a line will certainly make the whole thing go more smoothly. 4) Bumping into a student in a nightclub An awkward encounter many people can sympathise with. What is your favourite pupil Thomas doing in Flannerys at 2.30am? And he eating a Toffee Crisp for? Why is his mother shouting at you? Wait, why does Flanneys now look eerily like a suburban front garden. An easy mistake to make, worry about it. 5) Re-lax-ing-the-fuck-out Educating the little shits easy, we can only imagine, which is why teachers often just catch up on their sleep during a midterm.

She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades. Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election, I am fully convinced that World War III will begin before her time in the White House is over.

9347|CONTROVERSIAL NEW ‘ANTI-FAMINE’ GMO POTATO STRAINS APPROVED|"Home HEALTH | US NEWS CONTROVERSIAL NEW GMO POTATO STRAINS APPROVED CONTROVERSIAL NEW GMO POTATO STRAINS APPROVED 0 SHARES [11/3/16] The US Department of Agriculture has given its seal of approval to two new strains of genetically engineered potatoes. By using double stranded RNA, the potatoes have been engineered to resist the pathogen responsible for the Irish potato famine. There could be two new potatoes hitting the soil next spring after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed off on two more genetically modified potatoes from Simplot, an agribusiness based in Idaho, on Monday. The only obstacle for the new potatoes becoming available on the market is a voluntary review process from the FDA, much to the chagrin of GMO skeptics. Jeffrey Smith, founder of the Institute for Responsible Technology, expressed concern for not only the voluntary testing program but for the genetic modifying process the potatoes have undergone, in an interview with RT. It makes sense on paper, he said of the potatoes that are purported to be resistant to blight the pathogen responsible for the Great Famine. However, one of the issues is that the effects of modified these genomes are largely unknown. When we tamper with the genome in the way that been doing with genetic engineering in our food supply, you end up increasing allergens, toxins, new diseases or other problems causes massive collateral damage in the DNA he said. But blocking the blight is not the only selling point of these scientific spuds. In addition, they are meant to be engineered to prevent bruising and black spots, have a reduction of a chemical that creates carcinogens when cooked at high temperatures and also ship better. However, all of these benefits could be a curse in disguise. The method used for engineering these potatoes is called double stranded (ds) RNA, meaning the genes of an organism have been reprogrammed or silenced.

9365|Scientists Say Universe Is Part Of 4th Dimension Born From Black Hole|A new scientific theory claims our universe was born from an Event Horizon event as part of a second dimension in an enormous black hole gobbling up other universes in the fourth dimension. Via YourNewsWire At the very beginning of time, around 13.8 billion years ago, there was a hot dense energetic point where the laws of physics did not apply something scientists today refer to as a The only other place where a singularity occurs in the Universe and all the known laws of physics are temporarily abandoned is at the event horizon of a black hole which scientists cannot explain. Scroll Down For Video Below What is odd about black holes is that the even horizon is two-dimensional in an otherwise completely three-dimensional universe. This means that there is something that we are unable to perceive and the theory, which was first suggested in 2014 and is now under serious scrutinisation, claims that our Universe is the result of a singularity of a huge black hole. In simpler terms, there is a possibility that our three-dimensional Universe is surrounding the event horizon of a four-dimensional Universe. A 2014 study from the Perimeter Institute and University of Waterloo stated: In this scenario, our Universe burst into being when a star in a four-dimensional universe collapsed into a black hole. Re-visiting the theory recently, Ethan Siegel, a professor of physics and astronomy at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, explained how a black hole could have formed in another universe which led matter to fall into our Universe. Dr Siegel wrote for Forbes: As the black hole first formed, from a core imploding and collapsing, the event horizon first came to be, then rapidly expanded and continued to grow in area as more and more matter continued to fall in. If you were to put a coordinate grid down on this two-dimensional wrapping, you would find that it originated where the gridlines were very close together, then expanded rapidly as the black hole formed, and then expanded more and more slowly as matter fell in at a much lower rate. This matches, at least conceptually, what we observe for the expansion rate of our three-dimensional Universe.|2022-10-06 19:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|Times Today|35177|45828|485|2377|Mexico|English|2022-09-04 10:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|3067200|270000|2172|8.083333333333334

The New York Times piece does not go into detail about her movements since the FBI seemingly lost track of her, although it suggests she is still a person of interest to law enforcement. Her lawyers pop up early in the article to insist she did nothing wrong and to forbid questions about her discussions with federal agents. Salman said she had no idea what Mateen was up to on the day of the attack. She knew her husband watched jihadist videos, but she did not think much of it. But how could she have not suspected what her husband was planning she knew he had the weapons, she drove him to the nightclub and dropped him off: Noor Salman, wife of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, had all the hallmarks of a willing accomplice to her jihadist slaughter. Georgia State University professor Mia Bloom told The Times that studies show relatives and friends are aware of budding terrorist activities about 64% of the time and argued that abusive relationship with Salman give her a free pass as a bystander to not come forward. Salman insists she had no dark suspicions about several trips she took with Mateen that have been viewed as preparation for his terrorist career, although the lawyers notably intervened to prevent her from discussing the most notorious of these incidents the April 2015 trip to Disneyworld that Mateen may have used to case the park for an attack. Salman did nothing to warn the police of her intentions. When the FBI first questioned Salman, she admitted to bringing Mateen ammunition and a holster.

John Rossi committed suicide on July 31, making him the highest-ranking soldier ever to have taken his own life. Rossi, who was 55, was just two days from pinning on his third star and taking command of Army Space and Missile Command when he killed himself at his home at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. Investigators could find no event, infidelity, misconduct or drug or alcohol abuse, that triggered suicide, said a U.S. government official with direct knowledge of the investigation. It appears that Rossi was overwhelmed by his responsibilities, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation. Rossi himself talked in March about suicide at a conference on preventing troops from killing themselves. He held up a card from his wallet with photos of 10 soldiers who had died under his command at Fort Sill, Okla. Four of them had committed suicide. Rossi led off the event by reading the reports of recent suicide attempts to the soldiers at the event, according to a news story on the web site. He told the conference that he received reports of four soldiers per week thinking about or attempting suicide. We are ultimately responsible for soldiers both on and off duty, Rossi said. In a separate statement on Friday, family asked for privacy and called on soldiers with emotional problems to seek help. To all the other families out there, to the man or woman who may be facing challenging times, please seek assistance immediately, according to a statement released on the behalf by the Army. The Army, the armed forces and its veterans have struggled with the scourge of suicide since the 9/11 terror attacks and the wars that followed in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 20 veterans a day kill themselves, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, putting them at 21% higher risk of suicide compared with civilian adults. The suicide rate for active-duty troops was similar to that of civilians in 2014, according to the most recent data released by the Pentagon. The rate of 23.9 suicides per 100,000 soldiers was the highest among the services. Almost 20 years ago, Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the top sailor, killed himself with a gunshot to the chest.

9395|Someone Just Donated $2.5 Million to Bail Out Everyone Arrested at Standing Rock|By Nick Bernabe Following the recent mass arrests of 141 people at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site located near Standing Rock, North Dakota, an anonymous donor just donated $2.5 million to bail out everyone who was arrested at the protests. The news came after Tamara Francis-Fourkiller, a tribal leader from the Caddo Nation tribe in Caddo County, Oklahoma, was arrested at Standing Rock. Francis-Fourkiller was released after spending two days in jail, but her family says she was just an innocent observer in the clashes between militarized law enforcement and Native American activists, or water protectors. [ UPDATE 11/1 4:35 pm EST: A statement from Red Owl Legal Collective/National Lawyers Guild that is advising Standing Rock has issued a statement saying the $2.5 million has not been received yet. We are waiting on confirmation from the Caddo Nation tribe.] According to local news affiliate News On 6 : Family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site. They said, however, that Francis-Fourkiller should not have been arrested in the first place. Though the donor who sent the $2.5 million remains anonymous, it appears the person is connected to the Caddo Nation tribe in some way .|2022-10-10 13:00:00|FAKE|Daniel Patel|The Herald Tribune|73133|24734|4|4072|Iran|English|2022-10-09 07:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|3283200|3391200|1370|0.06666666666666667

Amir A, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna last December as part of a trip to encourage integration. When the youngster went to the showers, Amir A. allegedly followed him, pushed him into a toilet cubicle, and violently sexually assaulted him. Following the attack, the accused rapist returned to the pool and was practising on the diving board when police arrived, after the 10-year-old raised the alarm with the lifeguard. The child suffered severe anal injuries which had to be treated at a local hospital, and is still plagued by serious post-traumatic stress disorder. In a police interview, Amir A. confessed to the crime; telling officers the incident had been a sexual emergency, as his wife had remained in Iraq and he had not had sex in four months. A court found Amir guilty of serious sexual assault and rape of a minor, and sentenced him to six years in jail.

9404|Militarized Police Brutalize and Arrest Peaceful Protesters at Dakota Access Pipeline #NoDAPL|As of October 29, there have been at least 141 arrests of peaceful protesters at the Standing Rock Reservation who are attempting to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which poses a major threat to the drinking water of all people at Standing Rock. Paid for by Energy Transfer Partners , parent company to Dakota Access LLC, the DAPL is set to be embedded in a sacred burial ground at Standing Rock. This is the same area where DAPL security used attack dogs on peaceful people to intimidate protesters. Police snipers were seen peaking out of armored vehicles, aiming directly at unarmed protesters. These water protectors have been brutalized by officers who are using the color of law to help Dakota Access LLC trample on the the 1851 treaty between the US and the Cheyenne, Sioux, Arapaho, Crow, Assiniboine, Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara nations. Protesters who were arrested had handcuffs or zipties placed fixed to their wrists, they were stuffed into cages made for dogs and over-crowded cells, and they had numbers written on their arms, many of them having been brutally assaulted, tazed or even maced. Women were strip-searched in front of male officers. According to protesters, an elderly woman who had diabetes had blood sugar level of 488, which is dangerously high, and she was given no medical attention; they merely released her to deal with whatever health complications she had completely on her own. Zip ties were used to bind hands, and a number of protesters reported that these zip ties were tied so tightly around wrists that their hands were turning purple as a result of reduced blood circulation. Cars in the area were impounded. Officers had accessed the vehicles, allegedly to search them, but protesters are concerned that officers would be able to plant contraband in order to expand the charges against protesters. Over the weekend, an anonymous donor gave $173,000 to bail out protesters from jail. The International Indian Treaty Council has been listening to testimony over the past two days about human rights violations at Standing Rock.

Carter suggested involvement would only happen further down the road . The US announced that it intends to launch an invasion of Raqqa very soon, will conduct the operation concurrent with the ongoing invasion of Mosul in Iraq, and that Kurdish YPG forces will be providing the vast majority of the forces for this offensive. irked Turkey, particularly the last part, as Turkish officials repeatedly warned the US against allowing Kurds anywhere near Raqqa and have suggested their own involvement was contingent on there being no Kurds involved. comments suggest the US plan to invade without Turkey is unchanged, and that they intend to try to placate Turkey about the involvement of the YPG by giving them some involvement in the post-ISIS situation in Raqqa. Turkey is particularly keen to ensure that their own allies end up in control of Raqqa, and likely the main incentive of this deal.

Scroll Down For Video Below! So start off with a little fact from Wikipedia. Back in 2010, just in time to help Obama get elected again, Dominion Voting Machines bought out the right to own the machines in 22 different states.

That is just such a strange coincidence, you think? Right around the same time Hillary Clinton was deciding to retire as Secretary of State and focus on her campaign, this company bought out half the voting machines in the country.

So if a comedian and you want to be successful- bring politics into your act! Seriously, it just kills the mood, no one will be up to laughing after you insult them over who they are supporting for President, or whether or not they view abortion as murder. Who would find any humor in that? This should be common sense, but for Amy Schumer not. Now learning the hard way, what many of us were warning her about for a while now! According to AdWeek, Budweiser came in under expected profits in their third quarter, prompting the company to pull the Schumer ads ahead of schedule. The ads themselves were not at all doing well, and the last one received such negative attention on YouTube that it currently has more than 1,900 thumbs down, compared to only 300 thumbs up. Fox News reported that, at one time, the YouTube video had comments disabled, but that has since been changed. Many comments are negative toward Schumer herself, who has recently been in traveling around promoting feminist ideals and social justice causes. attitude on politics has alienated many people over the past few years, however. Many would say that the negative views on men, and hypocritical outrage, is often in complete contrast with inclusivity. This could have further attributed to the decline in Bud sales, as having a wildly unpopular figure represent your product will devalue it to the public. Sorry Schumer. Either be a comedian, or a social justice two however, do not play well together. Somewhere along the line you got that very obvious truth, twisted.

9443|Congress Knew For At Least Two Years About Pentagon Efforts To Take Back Bonuses From Veterans|Print Although members of Congress are now absolutely outraged the Pentagon is trying to recoup bonuses given out to thousands of troops, it turns out, Congress actually knew about this problem for at least two years. Andreas Mueller, chief of federal policy for the California National Guard, wrote an email to the California congressional delegation, stating the Guard told members of Congress about the bonus reclamation issue two years ago, The Los Angeles Times reports. In fact, Mueller noted that the Guard had even offered a solution, but Congress took zero action. In effect, the scandal stems back to about a decade when the National Guard was called upon to supply more troops. Guard officials were only supposed to give out bonuses to high-value positions like intelligence or civil affairs, to incentivize more soldiers to head to Iraq and Afghanistan during a marked troop shortage. But that rule was ignored and thousands of soldiers received bonuses they actually supposed to, unbeknownst to them. Now, the Pentagon wants those bonuses back and with interest. Since the story first broke Saturday, members of Congress have declared how abhorrent it is for veterans to be targeted with tax liens and wage garnishment for refusing to pay back these bonuses. GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Marine Corps reservist, wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Sunday, asking for him to get involved as to find a solution to this boneheaded decision . On the other side of the aisle, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi sent House Speaker Paul Ryan a letter Monday arguing that as soon as Congress gets back in session, members should immediately pass legislation to halt the collection efforts. Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer also wrote a letter to Carter, insisting that he had the power to simply forgive the debts without any action from Congress. Thousands of our service members are paying the price for mistakes made by California National Guard managers, some of whom are now serving jail time or paying restitution for their crimes, Feinstein and Boxer said . It is outrageous to hold these service members and their families responsible for the illegal behavior of others. But in the meantime, the California Guard certainly does not have the legal power to forgive debts, however much it might want to do so.

The New York DealBook reports: The cases relate to Android, mobile operating system, some of its dominant online search services and some of its advertising products. While each response will be couched in legalese, main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to more than 500 million consumers. Our search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results and most useful ads for any query, Kent Walker, general counsel, wrote in a blog post when previously rebutting some of antitrust charges. Users and advertisers benefit when we do this well. So does Google. The small European start-ups, some local politicians and significant American firms like with optimistic outlook. Google has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that still on the right track, said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, which represents those of rivals that filed complaints against the perceived dominance. I doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But what other previously dominant companies thought, too, he added. DealBook continues: Whatever happens, battle in Europe will not end overnight. European officials must first review the rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest. If found to have breached the rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process. Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.|2022-09-22 21:00:00|FAKE|Noah Khan|The Daily Dispatch|662561|91823|495|1337|Colombia|English|2022-09-17 01:00:00|Columna de humor|0|True|1864800|1360800|2265|8.25

9453|News: A Somber Moment: Cubs Fans All Over The World Are Still Too Sad About Princess Diana To Celebrate The Cubs’ World Series|Email Last night the Chicago Cubs eked out a thrilling game 7 victory in the World Series against the Cleveland Indians and ended a championship drought that had lasted for 108 years. This is a historic moment to be sure, but there will be no smiling and cheering in Chicago: Fans of the Cubs are still too sad over the death of Princess Diana to do any celebrating. I honestly never thought see the Cubs bring home the trophy, but everyone here is still too swept up with grief over Lady Di to really enjoy themselves right now, said Cubbies superfan Raymon Lindley, who was among the thousands of fans who gathered outside Wrigley Field following last edge-of-your-seat game to light candles in memory of the late Princess Of Wales. It would be macabre to celebrate the win in light of what happened to Princess Diana on that fateful August night in 1997. Theo Epstein, the curse-breaking president of baseball operations for the Cubs, has shipped the World Series trophy overseas to Britain, where it is to be laid on the grave of the Princess. While the people of Chicago are undoubtedly proud of their Cubs, no parade has been planned, as the general feeling of the city is that it would be too gratuitous at this time. I just called my 91-year-old grandfather, who waited his whole life to see the Cubs win the World Series, said longtime season-ticket holder Karen Hunter. We spent the entire call crying about Princess Diana together. She was so young. I would give a thousand Cubs World Series wins if Lady Di could be alive for one more day, Hunter added. History has been made, and the Cubs finally have their much-sought-after championship, but fans clearly still have a long way to go before comfortable celebrating the historic achievement. Aside from the occasional outburst of Candle In The Wind by groups of bereft fans, Wrigleyville will remain a quiet and mournful place until the Cubs faithful are ready to party with their victorious hometown heroes. And guess as to when that will be.|2022-10-09 20:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|City Times|527637|33742|940|2689|India|English|2022-10-05 00:00:00|Entrevista|0|True|3330000|2912400|2006|15.666666666666666
9458|Three Quarters Of Americans Oppose Gun Control|Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban Steve A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are against a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them. That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox: Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would eventually manufacturing in the United States.

Like so many Americans, Candice spent her morning lying in her bed, kicking herself for not having voted early, but as soon as it seemed like go back to sleep, her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen, curled themselves around the side of her bed, and threw her to the floor. After dragging her body to her living room, her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open. What started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby Jefferson Public School, where she dutifully filled out her ballot for President of the United States! If not getting out the vote, we know what is! definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls, but once ovaries had shot out of her body, they going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty!

While Android is particularly well known for offering a rabbit-hole of an operating system that can be tweaked and tinkered with, iOS has kept menus and settings relatively simple and locked down. However, there is a way that users can drill down to find some gems not seen on the surface. If you want to find out how many minutes you have left on your phone tariff, what your IMEI number (something need if you swap phone networks) or even find out a way to enhance your voice quality a way to do it that you find by going to your normal settings. Redmond Pie revealed a full list of the codes and how to use them. By typing in the following secret USSD codes on the dialpad of the phone then pressing the call button you can bring up these tricks: *3001#12345#* :Field Test mode *#5005*7672# : SMS centre number *3370# : Turn on or off EFR (Enhanced Full Rate), a mode that improves your call quality *#06# : Find out your IMEI number *#31# : Hide your number on calls option *#43# : Check if call waiting is on or off *43# : Turn on call waiting #43# : Turn off call waiting *646# : Check minutes left on contract *225# : Find out your current mobile account balance *777# : Find out prepaid account balance *#61# : Number of missed calls *#21# : Call forwarding status *#67# : Call forwarding number *#33# : Find out what mobile services are disabled on your phone One of the most interesting of the USSD codes is the Field Test mode, which allows users to see their phone-signal strength measured in numbers rather than those five bars. see something displaying such as with the number going up and down depending on signal. A value above -80 is a full-bar strength, but anything below -110 is very weak. This is a more accurate way of seeing whether you have enough signal to make a call, rather than holding on to hope with one-bar. worth noting that you should only use these codes and play around with your settings at your own risk, if not sure what something does better leave it be. source:|2022-09-09 04:00:00|FAKE|Michael Sharma|Press Pulse|434489|28098|43|653|Kenya|English|2022-09-03 16:00:00|Sin tipo|0|True|680400|205200|2226|0.7166666666666667

We have all seen supermoons before, but this particular full moon will be the second in a series of three this fall. The moon will peak on Monday, November 14th and it will be closer to the Earth than any other since 1948. The full moon will not come this close to Earth until 2034. The scientific term for a moon this magnificent is perigree moon which refers to when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit. When a perigree moon is full, it is known as a supermoon. This supermoon will appear 30% brighter and 14% larger than a normal full moon. This means that the night of November 14th will be one you will want to go outside for. NASA reports that we will be able to see a moon illusion that will make the moon look exceptionally big when viewed through foreground objects like tall buildings. The moon will reach the crest of its full moon phase at 8:52 a.m. Eastern time but it will look exceptionally big and bright all night. Astronomers have been monitoring the moon closely in order to better understand our solar system. For the past seven years, Lunar Reonnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has been mapping the surface of the moon as well as taking high-resolution photos to better understand the moon and Earth. Mapping the surface of the moon and learning about how been impacted by collisions with asteroids can shed light on the history as well. If you miss this supermoon, you will have one more chance to catch the last supermoon of 2016 on December 14th.

9490|Here is Elon Musk’s True Mars On Earth Plan|Here is Elon True Mars On Earth Plan 11/01/2016 GAME N GUIDE Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX recently held a Reddit Ask Me Anything session at 6:00 p.m. ET on Oct. 23. The session was said to be a follow-up to the speech in Mexico last month. Musk unveiled his plans for a refueling site and eventually habitation in the methane-rich planet. SpaceX is said to have raised more questions lately than it has revealed. The inventor and conglomerate went to Twitter to announce the session, Engadget reported. For instance, the plan on colonizing Mars is yet to be discussed as well as the reliability of its space rockets and how it can be improved. In addition, the company also previously revealed that it would be reusing their rockets but have kept mum on how. Previously, Musk had a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico in September. In the said Congress, Musk revealed his plans of sending humans to Mars apparently costing a whooping $10 billion each. Moreover he stated that humans will be turned into a multi-planetary species within the span of 40 years to a century. Musk revealed his vision with massive reusable rockets launching into a parking orbit stating that the rockets may be refueled by propellant tankers. Additionally, Musk plans to launch a thousand spaceships with a hundred people each en masse for Mars. He further revealed that a refueling station would be placed on the red planet to harvest methane fuel so settlers may come back to Earth. Hence, the first rocket to be sent is the Dragon spacecraft to search for a site to plant the refueling station followed by a spaceship with equipment to build the refueling station, LA Times reported. Musk went on to describe his ideal vision for human habitation on Mars. Musk revealed that glass panels with carbon fiber frames would be brought to the red planet to build geodesic domes on the surface.

Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis.

And even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it. Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him. This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California  James Thompson (@JETBallin) November 13, 2016 The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent African-Americans from getting equal rights. You can hang a n****r from a tree / Equal rights he will never see! it says. The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. In the wake of surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results. These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains white or colored at a Florida high school. Frankly, there are so many incidents that difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . This is what America looks like and scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that? Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her own supporters? Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. Because right now, she even First Lady yet and her effort has failed miserably.

9514|US Airstrike Kills Four Iraqi Troops Near Mosul|Nine Others Wounded in 'Friendly Fire' Attack by Jason Ditz, October 29, 2016 Share This As Iraqi forces continue to struggle to get closer to the ISIS city of Mosul during the ongoing invasion, a US friendly fire incident has been reported in the town of Tal-Kayf, a town which fell quite some time ago and in which recent fighting been reported. According to Iraqi military officials, the US airstrikes against the town killed at least four Iraqi soldiers and wounded nine others . The details are still scant on what happened, and the US has yet to comment on the incident at all. Iraqi officials are chalking it up as a mistake, but it is unclear why the town would be struck by US planes in the first place, as the Iraqi troops had been there for almost a week and there did not appear to be ISIS forces in the immediate vicinity. Iraqi forces confirmed the incident amid an announcement of more villages captured in the area west of Mosul. Many of the villages more than 5 km from the city have already fallen, and ISIS appears to be only sparsely defending those that remain, with the vast majority of their fighters hunkered down in Mosul itself, prepared for a major battle.

He points out that Trump advisor (and likely future cabinet member) Newt Gingrich gave a 2013 interview with The Washington Times expressing second thoughts about his neocon past. Though Trump has pledged to go after ISIS, his general philosophy seems far preferable to Hillary's systematic and carefully thought-out Wilsonian foreign policy.

9521|Jews ‘blamed for Holocaust’ at House of Lords event|Jews for at House of Lords event Jews for at House of Lords event By 0 60 Israel has condemned a shameful event hosted by the British House of Lords in which Jews were blamed for the Holocaust and Israel was compared to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). The session marked the launch of the Balfour Apology Campaign ahead of the Balfour Declaration centenary. The 1917 declaration pledged British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy said the gathering gave voice to racist tropes against Jews and Israelis alike. According to the Times, an audience member was applauded after suggesting Hitler only decided to kill Jews after being provoked by anti-German protests led by a rabbi, Stephen Wise, in New York. [He] made the boycott on Germany, the economic which antagonized Hitler, over the edge, to then want to systematically kill Jews wherever he could find them. Read more The speaker also said Rabbi Wise told the New York Times in 1905 there were 6 million bleeding and suffering reasons to justify Zionism. This quote is often used by Holocaust deniers to suggest the figure of 6 million Jews later killed by the Nazis was a myth. The audience member reportedly a member of the anti-Zionist strictly Orthodox Neturei Karta sect also compared Israel to IS. Just as the so-called Jewish state in Palestine come from Judaism. This Islamic State in Syria is nothing with Islam. It is a perversion of Islam just as Zionism is a perversion of Judaism. Another audience member said, to applause: If anybody is anti-Semitic, Israelis themselves. David Collier, a blogger who attended the session, says he witnessed a Jew-hating festival at the heart of the British estate. The event run by Baroness Tonge, a former Liberal Democrat MP who sits as an independent, and the Palestinian Return Centre. Tonge reportedly made no attempt to challenge the comments. She has run into trouble for her own anti-Israeli outbursts and resigned as the Lib Dem whip after claiming the state of Israel was not going to be there forever. The House of Lords event was also run by the Palestinian Return Centre. Campaigners are calling on Britain to apologize for the Balfour Declaration and show remorse for its past colonial crimes in Palestine. Via RT .

Others went online after voting, only to find that their mail in ballots, who listed Donald Trump as their candidate of choice, were not counted, supposedly because the signature on the ballot did not match the signature on the letter!

Exfoliation, hydration, and a natural makeup will do a great difference in November 1, 2016 at 6:25 am Botox is a toxin, it's not for ""taking care of your skin"". If you want to actually take care of your skin and reduce the appearance of your wrinkles, you should do a deep chemical peel once a year, derma roll every month, and use prescription Retin-A in between those things. Keeping the skin hydrated and nourished with consistent exfoliation is the key to young skin. So vitamin e oil, steam facials and natural moisturizers on the regular. As far as feminism and skincare/plastic surgery, I think it's less a gender issue than a reach to maintain biological attraction. Youth equals fertility, and because we're animals to attract a mate, generally it's about how ""fertile"" you appear.

Hillary campaign circulated the name of one of Paul relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair), reads the email. Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan. Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?|2022-10-07 09:00:00|FAKE|Sin autor|The Observer|547796|58170|176|2513|Turkey|English|2022-09-06 22:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|486000|3117600|2030|2.933333333333333

Folks, she had her MAID printing off piles of classified emails. Her server, which she kept in some bathroom closet, was HACKED by at least FIVE by foreign players. Hillary Clinton DESTROYED 33 THOUSAND emails AFTER receiving a congressional subpoena. Just because rich and powerful and has a rigged system saying INNOCENT make it so. Right now there are GOOD Americans rotting away in prison for doing the smallest fraction of what Hillary did. getting away with TREASON. Those were the exact words expressed from the Chairman of Homeland Security said. From the Washington Times: Michael McCaul was among the first to call choice to carelessly have a personal server which she used for State Department business a treasonous act. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Thursday said Hillary exposing sensitive information to potentially multiple hacks from foreign actors amounts to treason. This is why you have security protocols to protect classified information, Mr. McCaul said on Fox and Friends. She exposed it to our enemies, and now our adversaries have this very sensitive information that not only jeopardizes her and national security at home, but the men and women serving overseas. In my opinion, quite frankly, treason, said Mr. McCaul, Texas Republican. This needs to end. Our system is rotten to the core. The ONLY way to fix it, is to vote for Trump and #DrainTheSwamp.

Store manager Chuck Williams told reporters, We received a telephone call just before closing last night from a very excited gentleman, placing an order for over $120,000 worth of gold concrete paint. He continued It was quite a hurried conversation, and I catch everything he said, but I did hear the caller say something cryptic about turning a white house gold. I honestly have no idea what he could have meant, perhaps it was a riddle. And weirdly he kept referring to himself in the third person. At first we thought it might have been a hoax or someone out of their head on mind-altering substances, but we have checked our account and the money is already there, so we will start fulfilling the order immediately. When pressed by reporters, Mr Williams was reluctant to give further details for fear of breaching customer confidentiality, but he did confirm that the order was for a residence on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C 20500. He added, I know who this caller who referred to himself as Big could be, but he sure loves gold. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

I speak for south Florida , but as a longtime resident of north Florida I can promise you that there is a near frenzy of support for Donald Trump here. Over the past year I have seen endless amounts of Trump signs, stickers and banners. I saw a fair amount of pro-Bernie stuff as well. But pro-Hillary advertising? practically non-existent, I even seen half a dozen stickers and absolutely zero lawn signs. So I find it astonishing when I turn on the news and hear the libs talking about double-digit lead over Trump. not true, believe it. Donald Trump is doing great and is on track to win the White House in just under two weeks. The Republican presidential nominee has 45 percent to Democrat Hillary 43 percent among likely voters when third-party candidates are included, the poll found . In a hypothetical two-way race, Trump has 46 percent to 45 percent. DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN SAINT AUGUSTINE DRAWS TENS OF THOUSANDS: With over 4,000 people already inside the Saint Augustine Amphitheater, I took 60 seconds to do a walk-thru of just a fraction of the thousands of people in the overflow section who stood there for hours waiting to see Donald Trump. This is the type of support Trump has here in Florida. Among independents , Trump gets 43 percent to 41 percent in a head-to-head contest. When third-party candidates are included, Trump picks up 1 point with independents while Clinton drops to 37 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson taking 9 percent and the Green Jill Stein getting 5 percent. This race may come down to the independent vote, said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey. Right now, they tilt for Trump . By a narrow margin, they opted for Obama over Romney in 2012. showing in this poll is stronger than in other recent surveys in the state. Trump is also surging ahead of HIllary in Ohio and and is rapidly closing the gap in Pennsylvania.

Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are the main countries whose citizens come to Russia, Ukrainians migrate in large numbers, too.

Years ago, America led the world in space innovation. Astronauts like Neil Armstrong inspired generations of Americans to shoot for the stars . Science and technology programs flourished because children wanted to achieve the impossible. That dream has faded as our government has scaled back space programs over time.

Kasich, a millennial in an older body, provided several policy access to rape kits and confidential reporting, for then provided that one bit of advice. Recognizing within minutes that he might have stepped in it, the Kasich Twitter feed went hastily into damage control mode: This the first time that Kasich has made awkward comments about women this week. On Tuesday, he was baffled during a town hall when a young woman asked him about social security, responding, Did someone tell you to ask that question? (Her response: No, I think for myself.) Not surprisingly, Kasich has a history of making regularly cringeworthy comments about women. His greatest hits include telling a female questioner at a town hall I have any tickets for Taylor Swift, and bragging about how women left their kitchens to vote for him in Ohio.

9610|NBA Team Cancels Anthem Singer After She Tries Wearing Controversial Race Shirt Onto Court|I was never given any kind of dress code. I was never asked beforehand to show my wardrobe. Streeter (left) and the 76ers home court at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia I also felt it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America very important to me, Streeter said. Yes, we live in the greatest country in the world but there are issues that we cannot ignore. This be ignored. Advertisement - story continues below I was angry, extremely, extremely angry and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart, she said. Honestly, I was very excited about being able to perform the national anthem. I was really looking forward to that. Firstly, pro tip: The more times you say honestly about something, the more it becomes exponentially less likely to the listener that they will believe being honest. In this case, I believe Streeter honestly wanted to make a point, not sing the national anthem, which is the matter of contention here. The national anthem is sung to honor the heroes who have served (and died) for our country before major events. It time to make a point or have a discussion (a discussion, may I add, that usually takes the form of a monologue from whatever social justice warrior is giving it who usually acts surprised and disappointed when people have a real discussion and push back against their disrespect of the flag). If singing the national anthem, it about your opinions. It about your talent. It about what done.

9620|Trump Victory Necessary to Get US Into World War?|By Kevin Boyle on October 29, 2016 henrymakow.com Oct 28, 2016 I predicted Trump will win and asked my readers what the game plan is. While most readers favor Trump, Kevin Boyle and others suspect his real role is to lead Americans into WW3. Americans would never follow Hillary into battle. by Kevin Boyle ( Thanks for the article on Trump . I have been thinking about trying to write such an article on my own blog for a while. The key danger seems to me to be as follows: Trump is on a project to take back America. From whom? Well, quite obviously Jewish bankers. When he is elected he is in a perfect position to play the anti-banker-establishment game whilst a major war is engineered in which he will be a more than willing participant backed by the heartfelt support of an adoring and grateful public (very much in the Hitler fashion). The international banksters will get their war and they can even publicly oppose it so that they will get everything we know they want while taking NONE OF THE BLAME. It would be incredibly dangerous for them to try to use the hated Hillary to perform this duty in the current post-Brexit, Trumpist, Euro-Revolting anti-Banking world. Such a game plan is probably looking to these people, our traditional (but increasingly hated) masters as just PERFECT. They get their war, while anti-banker stooges and dolts can be ascribed blame and (as usual) actually take the blame for a situation that they, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, have artfully engineered. This looks like a highly possible, even probable, narrative for future events. On the other hand it is just possible that he means what he says and that Trump really intends, like Vladamir Putin, to make his culture overtly Christian again, to reduce the power and influence of the international banking cartel and set an admirable template of self-sufficiency, self-reliance and freedom for communities that other countries will rush to copy. Just possible. Highly unlikely but you never know. hoping and praying.

9625|The Fix Is In: NBC Affiliate Accidentally Posts Election Results A Week Early: Hillary Wins Presidency 42% to Trump’s 40%|NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting. The page, a screen shot of which has been sourced from internet archive site The Wayback Machine , is posted below and shows totals for the upcoming Presidential race. It announces Hillary Clinton as the winner. As Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results.

In addition to national results, Jim Stone has identified another page at the WorldNow.com FTP server that appears to show the State-By-State Presidential election results. This page is also accessible in archive format at WayBack Machine with a line by line breakdown available at website. Of interest is that the State-By-State results indicate a Hillary Clinton win in states like Texas (42% to 40%), Florida (44% to 40%) and Pennsylvania (44% to 40%) which have all been identified as states Clinton must steal to win the election . Do these latest election results confirm that the fix is in and the vote is rigged?

However, when she arrived at her rally in Lake Worth, Florida, she attempted to make one move that she hoped no one would notice. There have been many questions over the course of Hillary campaign regarding her health. As a result of her age and her lifestyle, no doubt that her body is starting to feel the effects of aging whether she likes to admit it or not. However, video footage of her recent rally in Florida shows how desperate she is to keep her health problems hidden, but her attempt was met with failure the moment she hit the stage. In fact, the Democratic presidential candidate struggled to climb one single step. The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser. She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness, according to The American Mirror . The aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches. Although Hillary Clinton insists that her health an issue, the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture. If you take a close look at the video, the aide can even be seen standing behind her, reaching for her waist probably preparing for the event of her falling. We have said it time and time again not fit to be president. Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person, her disastrous political history that raises, even more, concerns.|2022-09-15 08:00:00|FAKE|Nora Patel|The Insight|111023|74220|295|2386|Thailand|English|2022-09-01 18:00:00|Noticia de última hora|1|True|1213200|39600|1809|4.916666666666667

Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that the top diplomat is due in Moscow on Friday. He said that Zarif is scheduled to attend a trilateral meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem on regional developments, including the conflict in Syria. According to Qassemi, Zarif will also hold a separate meeting with Lavrov to discuss Tehran-Moscow relations. Meanwhile, Russia's RIA news agency, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry, reported that Zarif and Lavrov will also discuss the situation in Iraq. Muallem's scheduled visit on Friday had earlier been announced by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the war-hit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate. Iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the Syrian government in its campaign against terrorism. Russia has also been carrying out airstrikes against terrorists' positions in Syria since September last year at the official request of the Damascus government. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Over 400,000 people have so far been killed in the conflict, according to estimates by UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura . In neighboring Iraq, the Arab army is also pressing ahead with a massive operation aimed at recapturing Mosul from Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who captured the strategic city in June 2014. The army has been liberating more areas aroundMosul, with the Iraqi Joint Operations Command announcing that counter-terrorism units were only two kilometers away from the city.

9648|"It Begins: Crowds Mass In Major Cities: DC, LA, NYC, Philly, Portland, More… | Will It Escalate? | “95% Chance Of Widespread Violence”"|(Live Streams Available Below) Anti-Trump protesters are massing all over the country at this moment. Thousands of angry people in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Portland, New York and Los Angeles. The New York Times reports that crowds have been peaceful thus far: Protesters claim they are there to reject Trump racist policies and some say they fear mass deportations under a Trump Presidency. The anxiety began to build on social media this morning as scores of people called for protests, revolution and open threats to kill President Elect Donald Trump . In the build up to November 8th we warned that the situation post-election, regardless of who wins, could quickly escalate into open warfare and Mike Adams of Natural News warned of a 95% chance of widespread post-election violence . With large-scale protests now brewing in major cities across the country, we believe it is only a matter of time before some or all of these forecasts could come to fruition. Should things turn violent, though not confirmed by official sources, the Obama administration is prepared to respond. An insider leak last month indicated that the Federal government, including the military and the Department of Homeland Security, would be holding drills before and after the election in which they anticipate no rule of law. Such drills, should it be necessary, could very quickly go real-world. In such a scenario a lock-down of major cities following widespread rioting would be the likely course of action. There is a strong possibility that protests will be ongoing and that they may escalate.

Her concession speech was largely well received, even by her critics. Via Yournewswire She did not lash out or challenge the result. Excerpts of her concession speech Wednesday in New York. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love and about building an America hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America, and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things: the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too, and we must defend them. And let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation not just every four years, but all the time. So do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.

Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off something I thought never be able to do. I confess. never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says Britain should keep its options open on whether or not to leave the European Union until after Brexit talks with the bloc are completed. During an interview on Friday with BBC Radio 4's Today program, Blair described the EU referendum as a catastrophe and said UK voters should be given the option of a second EU referendum. Britain should not withdraw from the EU until it becomes clearer how Brexit would impact economic, social and cultural future, Blair said. ""The bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still don't know the precise terms, he said. got to be some way, either through parliament, or through an election, possibly through another referendum, that people express their view. The former premier, who was in office from 1997 until 2007, said it should be possible for the public to switch their verdict if it becomes clear the alternative negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May is going to be worse. argument contrasts sharply with that of May, who has repeatedly said that Brexit means Brexit and that respect the referendum result. Blair had argued that Britain should stay in the EU before the referendum. Economic growth in the UK is expected to slow significantly next year, due to uncertainty over of the Brexit vote. Experts have warned that leaving the EU will severely hurt position as a financial hub, unless the UK decides to keep its access to the single EU market by loosening its stance on immigration. If the UK loses its access to the single market, the resulting increase in the costs of doing business and exporting to the EU would hurt competitive position in Europe.

Tom Booker met church-goer Wayne Hayes when he started working in his office, and has expressed his surprise that he Booker said: We often end up in the kitchen at the same time to make a cup of tea, so we started exchanging pleasantries and worked up to longer conversations. He was always nice enough and talked about his family and allotment and stuff, so I presumed he was just a normal person. However, a few weeks later he mentioned something about believing in God. I was really shocked, but he seemed very cool about it. I asked if he thought it was just a phase and he said no, been feeling this way since he was about nine. I wanted to ask him what Christians actually do in church, but I got worried that he might think secretly into it and try to recruit me. He mentioned it since. almost as if a perfectly acceptable way to live your life, which has really given me pause for thought.

The Guardian reports today: Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. *** The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel, and that the reason why leaking is pro-Trump. *** The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his business dealings in Russia. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. Moreover, Clinton supporters have claimed that the emails found on Anthony laptop are only duplicates of emails the FBI has previously seen. However, CBS News reports : The FBI has found emails related to Hillary tenure as secretary of state on the laptop belonging to the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, according to a U.S. official.

They will come out on top regardless of who wins next week. There are more ""private"" contractors with top secret clearances than government employees. A recently released FBI memo referenced the ""7th Floor Group"" or ""Shadow Government"" made up of very high-ranking State Department officials and perhaps others.

9728|Is Donald Trump Autistic?|link Donald Trump could have a disability that used to be known as Aspergers, and this can cause people trouble when they try to socialize because their theory of mind is not complete. Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father's money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn't seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental. Donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to, which means he knows himself and his weaknesses. Many people with Aspergers don't get married because they have a hard time in relationships.|2022-09-27 23:00:00|FAKE|Ethan Hayes|Daily Beacon|385901|66545|252|7572|Nigeria|English|2022-09-16 18:00:00|Crítica|0|True|2304000|1335600|1569|4.2

Up to 48 people including 17 children have been killed in civilian areas of government-controlled western Aleppo since the offensive began, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. The goal of breaking the siege on eastern Aleppo does not give armed opposition groups a license to flout the rules of international humanitarian law by bombarding civilian neighbourhoods in government-held areas without distinction Samah Hadid, Deputy Director of Campaigns at Amnesty Beirut regional office Armed opposition groups have displayed a shocking disregard for civilian lives. Video footage shows they have used imprecise explosive weapons including mortars and Katyusha rockets, whose use in the vicinity of densely populated civilian areas flagrantly violates international humanitarian law. Armed opposition groups must end all attacks that fail to distinguish between military targets and civilians. On 30 October an alleged toxic gas attack took place in al-Hamdaniyeh and al-Assad areas of western Aleppo causing dozens of injuries according to the Syrian state news agency SANA. Chemical weapons are internationally banned and their use is a war crime. Such weapons cause immense suffering and health damage.

977|Sanders, losing in delegates to Clinton, claims 'path to victory'|"Bernie Sanders who is winning delegate contests against Hillary Clinton but not catching up much in terms of actual delegates insists he has a path to the Democratic presidential nomination, starting with primaries in New York and Pennsylvania. ""We believe that we have the momentum,"" Sanders said Sunday on ABC's This Week. ""We believe that the polling is showing that we're closing the gap."" The Vermont senator toured a string of Sunday shows a day after beating Clinton by double digits in the Wyoming caucuses though Clinton will wind up with more convention delegates thanks to ""superdelegates"" who can back any candidate they want. Speaking on NBC's Meet The Press, Sanders said he has cut Clinton's lead by one-third in recent weeks, won eight of the last nine delegate contests, and is moving up in national polls against both Clinton and potential Republican opponents. ""We're running stronger against Donald Trump and other Republicans than Secretary Clinton,"" Sanders told NBC. ""I think we stand a really good chance to do well in New York State, in Pennsylvania, and as we head into other states."" The New York primary is April 19, and Clinton holds a double-digit lead there, according to recent polls. Pennsylvania along with Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island holds its primary a week later. The Associated Press reports that, when superdelegates are included, Clinton holds a significant lead over Sanders: 1,756 to 1,068. Sanders said he believes his campaign can block Clinton from winning the 2,383 delegates needed for nomination at the convention. ""I believe that we have a real path to victory,"" Sanders said on CBS' Face The Nation, ""and that at the end of the day, we're going to win this."" The former New York senator and secretary of State told CNN's State of The Union on Sunday: ""I intend to have the number of delegates that are required to be nominated."|2022-09-30 19:00:00|REAL|Aria Shah|Daily Digest|925048|69213|385|1527|Thailand|English|2022-09-18 08:00:00|Editorial|0|True|1472400|2548800|1898|6.416666666666667
9770|Massive marine park declared in Antarctic Ocean|This undated handout photo received from the Antarctic Ocean Alliance on October 28, 2016 shows a Adelie penguin on pack ice in the Ross Sea in Antarctica. © AFP International leaders have joined hands to create the largest marine park in the Antarctic Ocean. The European Union and 24 countries have reached a momentous agreement to open the Ross Sea Park. The deal was sealed in Hobart, Australia after prolonged negotiations run by the United Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The Ross Sea marine park will cover an area of 1.55 million square kilometers and is to be protected from commercial fishing for 35 years. The preserved area covers more than 12 percent of the Southern Ocean and is home to more than 10,000 species. Scientists and activists consider the deal a historic milestone after decades of global efforts in marine preservation. The Ross Sea is seen as one of the world's most ecologically important oceans for its unique qualities. Scientists believe that the marine park can be a platform for a deeper understanding of climate change impacts. The 25-member commission comprised of Russia, China, the US and the EU had to have unanimous support for the decision.

9772|Crimean and Donetsk leaders comment on US elections|November 10, 2016 - Fort Russ News - PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - Crimean leader Sergey Aksenov welcomed the choice of the American people in the US presidential elections despite what he called numerous violations in the electoral process. Aksenov stated: The American people have made their choice. Our president was clear: the Russian Federation is not interfering in or even making any attempts to influence the will of the American people. In my opinion, the elections were held with numerous violations. If this had happened in Crimea or Russia, then the elections would have been assessed differently by American politicians. They would say that everything was wrong and illegitimate. But the Americans did not allow Russian diplomats near polling stations and prevented the formation of an objective view of what was happening at polling stations and overall how the elections were being held in the US. Commenting on pre-election promises in regards to Russia and the Republic of Crimea, Aksenov said: Before elections, politicians usually make some statements, and then their program can radically change. Time will tell. I am sure that our president will make sufficient efforts so that Crimea will be recognized throughout the world. This summer, Trump stated that he would be ready to look into the question of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and lifting the sanctions against Russia if he won the elections. He remarked that Crimeans want to be with Russia and that this should be considered by the international community. These words caused great anxiety in Kiev. The leader of the Donetsk Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko, was cautious in being optimistic towards election as US president. Zakharchenko expressed concern that after Trump moves into the White House, he will become part of the American political system and there is no guarantee that he will be able to resist this system. For the DPR, suggested policies could signal a change in attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis. Follow us on Facebook! Follow us on Twitter!

The image is placed under a headline reading: Councils resist pressure to take children from Calais.

""It means that the Russian Central Bank has been running a justifiable policy, because the bank has been purchasing gold during the recent three years. Now gold will cost even more. Citizens still have an opportunity to buy gold investment coins that are VAT-free in Russia, unlike bullions. ""In Russia, there are three ways of investing in gold. They include unallocated bullion accounts in banks - bullions and coins. This method is bad because unallocated bullion accounts are excluded from the deposit insurance program. Therefore, if a bank collapses, the state will not give you anything back. ЭA bullion is a good investment, but in Russia, this investment shall include 18% of value added tax. Therefore, your price per one gram or one ounce of gold will be 18 percent higher. Gold investment coins are exempt from VAT, so this is the most profitable way among those that exist. ЭIn Russia, the most common gold coin is known as ""Pobedonosets"" or ""Victorious."" This is a quarter of an ounce coin. The global standard is one ounce or 31 grams.

Rather than a culture of service, executives have pushed a high-pressure sales culture since 2009, demanding frontline employees meet extreme quotas of selling a myriad of unnecessary bank products to common depositors who just wanted a simple checking account. (Photo: Shutterstock) Employees were expected to load each customer with at least eight accounts, and employees were monitored constantly on meeting their quota fail and be fired. why the sales culture turned employees into a syndicate of bank robbers. The thievery was systemic, and it subtle. Half a million customers were secretly issued credit and debit cards they request, fake email accounts for online services were set up without knowledge, money was moved from one account to another, signatures were forged, and of course Wells Fargo collected fees for all of these bogus transactions, boosting its profits. CEO John Stumpf was recently forced out because of the scandal, but what about the other top executives and the board of directors all of whom were highly paid partners in this crime?

To see the crest besmirched by Wayne Rooney wearing it while wandering around the pitch like in IKEA is a disgrace. England manager Gareth Southgate said: The decision whether to wear the three lions should be a personal one, unless you fuck up a vital penalty inexplicably taking in a major tournament, in which case you should be allowed nowhere near them.

9831|"Debunked: The Photo Of Obama With A Speech Balloo... | ClickHole"|Email In an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds, often difficult to separate fact from fiction. That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online, with many insisting that the image was the real, unedited deal. But today that picture was officially debunked: The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying Islam is my main thing has been proven to be doctored. Wow. This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt! Take a look at the photo in question above. In it, you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith. At first glance, the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most far-right critics, who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs. But when the image went viral on Twitter, one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring: Many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in. A graphic designer named Brendan McCann, whose Twitter bio says been in the industry for over a decade, quickly answered the call. But it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest. After scouring the internet far and wide, they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph, taken during one of the official White House photo ops, and no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight. Take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved: Well, there you have it. It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top. a powerful effect, but definitely not real. Remember: When it comes to the internet, always question your sources!|2022-09-14 06:00:00|FAKE|Marcus Liu|Express Tribune|257897|30346|58|7509|Turkey|English|2022-09-10 02:00:00|Noticia de última hora|0|True|759600|1119600|1912|0.9666666666666667

In an interview with the humanitarian organization Roads of Success, Syrian mom Alice Assaf went into chilling detail about the atrocities the jihadists committed about two years ago in the town of Douma, explaining that some of the youngsters were even decapitated in front of their parents, according to the Express. We heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them, Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine, Assaf said, according to media reports. They were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old. ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. My son said to me, mother, I want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,' Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. Assaf added, I asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.'

However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. Gruber said, not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which covered 20 million, the largest expansion in american history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurors could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare. When asked about the 22% Obamacare premium increases, Gruber stated, the 22% increase, remember who that applies to.

In it, he accuses the controversial FBI Director of sitting on secret explosive intelligence information about the Republican presidential coordination with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Reid wrote : The double standard established by your actions is clear. In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. Senator Reid continued by notifying Comey of violating the Hatch Act, whic forbids federal employees from engaging in partisan acts. Even further, Reid said that he regretted helping President Obama break a long Republican filibuster of his nomination to head the FBI just three short years ago. not surprising that there is a tangible link between Putin and Trump, especially after an interview of the Republican claiming he has a relationship with the Russian dictator was unearthed by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump and authenticated by MSNBC host Thomas A. Roberts this week . Which begs the question, what is the Republican standard bearer hiding regarding his dealings with Vladimir Putin?

(Photo by AFP) Cypriot political leaders have agreed to continue talks in Switzerland next month in an attempt to reach an agreement on the reunification of the Mediterranean island country, the United Nations (UN) has announced. A UN spokesman, Aleem Siddique, made the announcement on Wednesday, saying Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci will meet at Mont Pelerin, near Lake Geneva, from November 7 to 11. Siddique said the two leaders, in the presence of the UN envoy for Cyprus, will concentrate their talks on how much territory each side will administer under an envisioned federation and will discuss all other outstanding issues, too. The leaders have expressed hope that the Switzerland meeting will pave the way for the last phase of talks in line with their shared commitment to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within 2016, the UN spokesman said. Negotiations on reuniting the Mediterranean island under a single federal roof have made significant headway since Anastasiades and Akinci resumed talks led by the UN nearly 18 months ago. However, important differences still remain on the question of territorial arrangements, security and property rights. Previous UN-mediated talks to reunify the Mediterranean island faced a deadlock in October 2014 when Turkey announced plans to search for oil and gas in waters off Cyprus. Cyprus has been divided since 1974, after an intervention by Turkey, which came when a military coup was carried out by individuals who sought to unify the island with Greece. Nearly one decade later in 1983, Turkish Cypriots declared an independent state, which has only been recognized by Ankara. Turkey has some 35,000 soldiers stationed in the north of that part of Cyprus. Cyprus has been a European Union (EU) member since 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits.

Gold is unobtainable for most people in the world the way priced right now. If a global crisis hits silver is going to be remonetized by the free From PM Fund Manager Dave Kranzler : If not just an industrial metal, like it is today, if governments and central banks start holding it (silver), and this is a copy-cat effect, because obviously you know this, once one of the central banks does something the rest will do it because they want to be different. Lior Gantz, The Daily Coin, Silver Will Be Re-Monetized By The Market I n 1965 Lyndon Johnson signed the Coinage Act of 1965, which removed the silver content from dimes and quarters and took the silver content in half-dollars down to 40%. In 1970 silver was removed completely from the half-dollars. The excuse given was that the country was running out of silver. But the truth is that the U.S. Government in conjunction with England was dumping its Central Bank stock of silver (and gold) onto the market in order to prevent the price of these precious metals from rising against the U.S. dollar, which had been effectively the reserve currency for 20 years. In fact, the silver-based U.S. coins were disappearing from the market because the value of the silver content in these coins had risen above the face value of the coins. It was real-time proof of Law. In effect, it was an effort by the U.S. Government to de-monetize silver, which has been civilized oldest monetary metal. The U.S. could not yet de-monetize gold because, based on the Bretton Woods Agreement, the U.S. was required to back all Treasuries bonds issued to foreign buyers with gold. But a year after the last remnants of silver were removed from U.S.-minted coins, the Nixon Government disconnected gold from the reserve currency. Ultimately, silver will become re-monetized. Silver has been, is and always will be poor gold. In episode of The Daily Coin, we discuss the eventual re-monetization of silver.

988|Donald Trump’s Shockingly Weak Delegate Game Somehow Got Even Worse|Donald organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing. Politico with the play-by-play from this Colorado GOP convention, the latest scene of delegate-securing failure: Unlike in most other states, Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this national convention in Cleveland. Instead, the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention, and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend. It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of put another way, not the Trump campaign. At the first two district-level contests, the team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees, leaving supporters unsure of whom to back. And then at last contest, two of the three delegates on the Trump list actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees. This past mix-up, though, was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trump-sanctioned list lined up with a Cruz-supporting delegate, according to NBC News. (Even without that mix-up, though, Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well-oiled delegate-selecting machine.) The Trump camp, though, appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake, pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the party's website and the printed materials distributed at the event. We'll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado, Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC, suggesting the campaign may challenge the results. Clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting. Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but far from assured of the majority of delegates need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most leave without the nomination.|2022-10-05 10:00:00|REAL|Amelia Rivera|Times Today|625588|56885|82|1137|Russia|English|2022-09-21 08:00:00|Opinión del lector|0|True|1731600|2948400|2417|1.3666666666666667

More on this: DEVELOPING: FBI Reopens Investigation into Clinton Emails After New Evidence Discovered While Director Comey declined to provide specific details on what the newly discovered Clinton emails contained, federal law enforcements officials speaking under anonymity have explained that the emails were found on the personal devices of Clinton aide Huma Abedin and disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner. The discovery came as part of investigation into yet another Weiner scandal, this time after he was alleged to have been engaging in sexually explicit conversations with an underage female. More on the latest Weiner scandal: Strikes Again: New Reports Allege Anthony Weiner Knowingly Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conversations with 15 Year Old Female Online As reported by the New York Times, authorities discovered emails related to the Clinton investigation on personal electronic devices belonging to Abedin and Weiner that had been seized by investigators as part of the investigation in alleged inappropriate conversations with a child. Via NYT Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, an aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner. The F.B.I. told Congress that it had uncovered new emails related to the closed investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides had mishandled classified information, potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J.

Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information, he said. This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.

Speaking to representatives of the Association of European Businesses in Moscow on Tuesday, Russia's top diplomat explained how Western countries have absolutely contradictory approaches to virtually identical problems in Yemen and Ukraine. At the meeting, Lavrov devoted a great deal of his speech to the subject of the crisis in Ukraine, the issue which effectively sparked the crisis in relations between Western countries and Russia, and resulted in tens of billions of dollars in economic losses for both sides, not to mention heightened military tensions. © Sputnik/ Vladimir Sergeev Saving Face: 'West's Attitude to Crimea Will Not Change' After US Elections Pointing out the difference in approach to Western policy in response to the crises in Ukraine and that in present-day Yemen, the foreign minister effectively schooled Western officials for their illogical behavior. Lavrov recalled that when Yemen faced a coup in September 2014, and Yemeni President Hadi fled to neighboring Saudi Arabia, Western politicians reacted by demanding the reinstatement of the country's legitimate president. However, facing the exact same situation in Ukraine in February 2014, US and European leaders reacted very differently. ""For over two years, the international community has been demanding that President Hadi be returned to Yemen and his legitimacy be reaffirmed,"" Lavrov recalled. ""But our European colleagues, who share this view, remain silent when we ask them why the same principled approach cannot be applied to Ukraine."" Lavrov pointed out that two-and-a-half years ago, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland brokered a deal between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition, promising early elections in exchange for his security and an end to riots in the streets of Kiev. But just hours after the deal was signed, Yanukovych was ousted, and forced to flee in fear for his life. Apparently, the diplomat said, European officials ""have more respect for Yemen and its political system than for Ukraine, where experiments can continue it seems. Ukraine has been suffering from this for several decades now."" ..."|2022-10-04 13:00:00|FAKE|Avery Kim|Times Today|346756|15079|149|9579|Ukraine|English|2022-10-04 07:00:00|Artículo de investigación|1|True|2851200|2872800|2248|2.4833333333333334

This year was no different at the VA hospital when 87-year-old Vincent Arnold, a veteran of three wars, was offered a complimentary serving of mashed potatoes in the cafeteria as a thank you for his 30 years of military service. Normally, the Patriot combo meal includes 2 pieces of fried chicken , a side of mixed vegetables and a 12-ounce drink. On Veterans Day, all veterans are given a scoop of mashed potatoes free of charge. Purple Heart recipients are also given the option of brown or cream gravy as a special recognition for the physical suffering they endured while fighting for our freedom. We always make sure our veterans have a very special Veterans Day, stated hospital administrator Nathan Bishop while opening a box of miniature American flags that will be placed in every room.

""He also understood that winning isn't enough, that it's about how you win and how much you win."" Manafort told CNN, ""I work directly for the boss,"" a notable departure from the usual workflow at Trump's 2016 operation, where most campaign staff answer to campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Manafort joins the Trump campaign as a contested Republican convention becomes more likely. Trump suffered a critical loss to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Tuesday in the Wisconsin primary. However, the strategist says he is confident the Cruz campaign will hit a rough patch, allowing Trump to win the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright. ""Utah and New York are two different states,"" he said. ""By the time we get to California, the momentum is going to be clear, and Ted Cruz's path to victory will be in shambles."" Donald Trump has 746 delegates to date of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, meaning Trump would have to win the remaining 61% of delegates up for grabs. RELATED: Donald Trump looks to dominate New York Manafort is also optimistic Trump will block Cruz's chance of winning on the first ballot if the convention is contested. ""You got to understand what the game is. If the game is a second, third or fourth ballot then what he's doing is clever, but on the first ballot it is meaningless."" Manafort's experience in campaigns goes back to the 1976 contested Republican convention . Trump's hiring of Manafort fueled speculation he was replacing campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. However, Manafort insists there was no internal shakeup. ""I listen to everybody,"" he said.

9906|November supermoon biggest in nearly 70 years|November supermoon biggest in nearly 70 years 11/03/2016 USA TODAY Supersized! November supermoon will be biggest in nearly 70 years. The supermoon occurs when the moon is slightly closer to Earth than it typically is, and the effect is most noticeable when it occurs around the same time as a full moon. It can appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than usual, according to NASA. The word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, Mark Paquette says. Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth. Instead of a supermoon, astronomy site Slooh.com is calling it a mega beaver moon, which includes the folklore name for November. According to the Old Almanac , the November moon was named the beaver moon partly because, for both the colonists and the Algonquin tribes, this was the time to set beaver traps before the swamps froze, to ensure a supply of warm winter furs.

The US authorities always denied that monarchies of the Persian Gulf funded Jihadists, asserting that support came from rich donors of those countries.

From Daily Express : The father of the pupil at the primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. He claimed she had been forced by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. The handout read: Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you. It had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the Bavarian school. Headteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their nursery was refusing to acknowledge Christmas rituals to accommodate the diverse cultures of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils were Christian. A spokesman for Kassel explained: There will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.

9909|News: Hope For The GOP: A Nude Paul Ryan Has Just Emerged From An Ayahuasca Tent With Visions Of A New Republican Party|Email Since Donald Trump entered the election over a year ago, he has single-handedly destroyed the GOP, leaving both the House and the Senate in utter disarray. But although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done, conservatives lose hope yet, because Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new Republican Party. A fresh GOP platform requires fresh leadership, and when Speaker Ryan journeyed to South America last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth, he just proved the only one for the job. After traveling to Peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel, 200 mg of DMT, and a bucket to vomit in, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spent the last 12 hours lying nude on the jungle floor, enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified, more moderate GOP unfold before his very eyes. While under the influence of the powerful psychedelic, ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman, instructed him to remove his clothes, and held him down as lifelike projections of Republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies, all to create a Republican Party that mobilizes key voter constituencies. Check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the Amazon rain forest! Whoa. Democrats have been pretty confident this past year, but if Paul visions of the Republican party are right, they better watch out! Say what you want about Paul Ryan, but a man who refuses to give up. On the one hand, is it possible that the grand ayahuasca visions of a new Republican Party are just a temporary fix? Sure. But on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind. One thing is for sure: Paul Ryan emerged fully nude from that ayahuasca tent with a new perspective, and people are starting to take notice.|2022-09-07 03:00:00|FAKE|Ava Murphy|The Pulse|106690|51437|338|1015|South Africa|English|2022-09-03 23:00:00|Opinión del lector|1|True|504000|230400|2186|5.633333333333334

If you doubt this fact, consider what was said earlier today at a Trump rally being held in Las Vegas. Author and self-described capitalist evangelist Wayne Allyn Root was giving a rambling speech as a warm-up before Der Fuhrer Donald took the stage, and while portions of it were comparable to the rantings of Charles Manson after too much caffeine, it was the language Root used (highly militaristic and warlike) that you cannot help but notice. At various points in his unhinged diatribe, Root used the following phrases : Trump warriors Trump army Trump revolution Then, in full psychotic rant, Root attempted to mix together plot elements from the O.J. Simpson case with the movies Driving Miss Daisy and Thelma and Louise , telling the ecstatic crowd : Hillary in a White Ford Bronco. got Huma driving and headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. called Driving Miss Hillary. And the ending, if we all get our wish, is like Thelma and Louise! Finally, Root ended his echo of Nuremberg by declaring: I will give you my country when you pry it from my cold dead hands. When I listen to Wayne Allyn Root (or any of the other fanatical Trumpkins), the movie that comes to mind for me is One Flew Over the Nest.

Gas all the same, shared Louth native Trevor Gorman, whose uncle would periodically go up north for something called in the 90s. Look, just have to give me some time. People in the Middle East are well accustomed to violent loonies hiding behind a religion to commit horrible acts, but this is all new to us, and him being mad, said Cavan man Sean Dignam, from the comfort of a stool in an IRA owned pub.

9937|Obama Administration Smacks Down Enlistment Bonus Repayments After Republican Congress Does Nothing|For those of us too ensnared in the Trumpster fire to pay attention to anything substantive, a majorly screwed up thing was happening to our fighting men and women. The LA Times broke the story that the Department of Defense has been ordering almost 10,000 one-time National Guardsmen from California to pay back enlistment bonuses due to an error over a decade ago. Horror stories began pouring in of soldiers being notified that they MUST pay back the money or face wage garnishments, tax liens and interest charges. This, of course, prompted the Obama administration to take immediate action while our do-nothing Republican Congress focuses on such important issues as defunding Obamacare. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced today that the Pentagon will suspend efforts to recoup bonuses overpaid to troops more than a decade ago. There is no more important responsibility for the Department of Defense than keeping faith with our people. That means treating them fairly and equitably, honoring their service and sacrifice, and keeping our word, Carter added. Of course, Republicans love to wear the biggest flag pins they can find and feign love for the troops come reelection time, but really put their words into action. This might explain why they did NOTHING to stop this. It seems the California National Guard told the members of Congress two years ago that the Pentagon was making every effort at taking back its promised re-enlistment bonuses from thousands of soldiers. In fact, the California National Guard went so far as to develop a plan to assuage the problem. However, being the greedy do-nothing leaches that they are, the Republican-led Congress lift a finger. Once again, the Obama Administration is forced to step in and help the very people Republicans claim to love so much.

994|The Boston Globe imagined how it would cover a President Donald Trump. It's horrifying.|As part of an editorial calling for Republicans to stop Donald Trump from becoming their presidential nominee, the Boston Globe on Sunday imagined what covering a President Trump would be like on its front page. The Globe took some editorial liberties with how Trump's plans would impact the US, including the potential for riots, markets crashing, and the military refusing to obey Trump's orders. It is an exercise in taking a man at his word. And his vision of America promises to be as appalling in real life as it is in black and white on the page. It is a vision that demands an active and engaged opposition. It requires an opposition as focused on denying Trump the White House as the candidate is flippant and reckless about securing it. The Globe's predicted results to Trump's policies don't seem too far off from reality: Deporting 11 million unauthorized immigrants would likely cause a lot of social unrest in the US, and Trump has explicitly called for violence at his rallies. Imposing taxes on foreign goods if Trump can't get the trade deals he wants would very likely hurt the economy. And former CIA Director Michael Hayden warned that the military really would ignore Trump's orders to go directly after the relatives of ISIS members and other terrorists. The Globe looks at all of these possibilities with horror enough to publish a satirical front page and call for Republicans to stop Trump at a brokered convention, regardless of the risks to the party.|2022-09-11 23:00:00|REAL|Grace Liu|The Daily Dispatch|658081|20918|688|0|Germany|English|2022-09-04 02:00:00|Artículo de investigación|1|True|921600|241200|1478|11.466666666666667

9948|US Airstrikes on Iraqi Army Slowing Advance on Mosul|By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on October 29, 2016 Several Iraqi Soldiers killed by US Airstrike Near Mosul With a blocking force in place preventing ISIS from moving into Syria, reported by Iranian press, the US is doing everything possible to slow down the Iraqi Army and prevent successful operations. There have long been suspicions that the Kurds, who let thousands of ISIS oil trucks through their region each week, have been working with ISIS all along. It was the Kurds, not the real Kurds, but Saudi run dictatorship in Erbil, that invited Turkey into Iraq. Deputy Chief of the Nineveh Provincial Council Noureddin Qablan announced that the US-led coalition warplanes have launched airstrikes on army base in Nineveh province, killing several soldiers. The US fighter jets hit one of the military bases of Iraqi 16th Division in a region North of Mosul, and the attack left at least four Iraqi soldiers dead, Qablan said. According to FNA, He said that the US army has confirmed the attack, calling it a mistake. Qablan said that it is not the first time the US warplanes hit the Iraqi army and volunteer forces (Hashd al-Shaabi) military positions, adding, The US-led coalition has each time said that air raids were not deliberate. It is reported that another peshmerga convoy accidentally hit by an USA-led coalition airstrike near Mosul today. was 3 Mistakan Raid in 24 hours.

9950|Cardinal Vincent Nichols says: “Britons could learn a lot from the ‘vibrant’ faith of Muslim migrants”|Cardinal Vincent Nichols says: Britons could learn a lot from the faith of Muslim migrants British people have much to learn from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith of new immigrants including refugees, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has said. UK Telegraph Cardinal Vincent Nichols said immigrants had been enduring a worsening atmosphere of fear in the months since the EU referendum with the members of the public casually voicing hatred in a self-indulgent way. (Self-indulgent? I wonder what this French priest would have to say about that?) H e accused politicians of trading in fear and said media stories constantly portraying immigration in a negative light were proving corrosive of our best nature. In an interview with the BBC , he insisted that increasingly secular British society could learn much from the faith of new arrivals whether Muslims or followers of other religions. Of course what we have to learn too is from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith that comes here. H e added: I think the immigration crisis is real and it needs concerted effort to address it, he said. It needs to be addressed realistically with resources and proper legislation, but almost impossible to do that in an atmosphere in which fear and hatred are the dominant features. It does nobody any good, this somewhat self-indulgent way in which people have begun to express themselves and their distaste and their hatred of people who they see as different. And that is creating a culture of fear among people who have been welcomed here.|2022-10-03 02:00:00|FAKE|Emily Parker|World News Network|504905|37077|356|6029|Vietnam|English|2022-09-15 21:00:00|Análisis|0|True|1260000|2746800|1557|5.933333333333334
9954|Incredible smoke haze seen outside NDTV office after Arnab quits; bursting of firecrackers suspected|Incredible smoke haze seen outside NDTV office after Arnab quits; bursting of firecrackers suspected Posted on Tweet (Image via  An incredible smoke haze was spotted seen outside the NDTV office on Tuesday. Onlookers claimed that the reason was and uninhibited bursting of firecrackers by people in the building. One onlooker claimed he also heard loud firecrackers-like noise near the NDTV office area followed by fumes curling up to form a V-sign. Experts say it will be difficult to ascertain the source of the emission. A leading pollution expert opined, These days such peculiar fumes can be due to firecrackers during the Diwali season or because of pure human emotions giving rise to intense celebrations, revelry, etc. This incident, according to the onlooker, happened on Tuesday evening, minutes after the news of journalist Arnab Goswami quitting Times Now surfaced. The UnReal Times could not verify whether the two events were correlated as the onlooker tried to imply. A few onlookers however insisted the fumes could be a smokescreen to hide some kind of celebrations inside the office. The UnReal Times could not even verify whether there was pun intended in this claim. Similar incidents of smoke over other media houses were reported too. Outside the CNN IBN office, one could see similar fumes rising, triggering alarm bells among onlookers. Again, firecrackers could have been behind the smoke, according to the observers. Outside the India Today office, not only was smoke seen rising in the air but a grey-haired man was seen enthusiastically distributing sweets among strangers. When asked, what was he celebrating the man replied, Should we celebrate Diwali only during Diwali? Why not a day later? Does that mean we have become anti-national? When asked if the celebration had anything to do with the Arnab Goswami resignation, the man replied with a grin, Shubhratri. Good night! Strangely, outside the Times Now office, no smoke was detected. Tweet About Amrut Thobbi Amrut Thobbi is an editor by profession, satirist by heart and useless as a person.

He has several names in mind, names that will literally change America and CNN like this at all. Well, too bad! VIA Conservative 101 According to Politico , some of those names include Gingrich for Secretary of State, Mnuchin, a 17 year veteran of Goldman Sachs for Treasure Secretary and Mayor Giuliani for Attorney General. And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary. He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter. CNN was terrified by this. I think the one major flag I have is that someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as his Homeland Security secretary? Someone who I very much see as if not a terrorist inciting terrorism? said CNN commentator Angela Rye. If people are afraid of Sheriff Clarke, afraid of the policies which he represents, I think terrorism, she said. This of course, makes no sense. You just call people who disagree with you terrorists. Check out the video below and see for yourself. Now, this makes me what gives Angela the right to call an honest person like Sheriff Clarke a terrorist? Is it jealousy?

9977|Two Points About the Hillary Clinton Email Fiasco|Much is being made of Hillary private email server, which she used when she was Secretary of State. To me, the real issue is not that Hillary endangered national security by sending classified information in the clear. No the real issue is that the Clintons act as if they are above the rules and laws that apply to the little people. They are superior and smug, totally devoted to themselves and their pursuit of power and the privileges that come with it. a matter of character, in other words. evasiveness, her lack of transparency, her self-righteousness, her strong sense of her own rectitude, make her a dangerous candidate for the presidency. My second point is this: The issue of classification should be turned on its head. The real issue is not that Hillary potentially revealed secrets. No the real issue is that our government keeps far too much from us. Our government uses security classification not so much to keep us safe, but to keep the national security state safe safe from the eyes of the American people. As The Guardian reported in 2013 : A committee established by Congress, the Public Interest Declassification Board, warned in December that rampant over-classification is informed government decisions and an informed and, worse, corruption and In one instance it documented, a government agency was found to be classifying one petabyte of new data every 18 months, the equivalent of 20m filing cabinets filled with text. Nowadays, seemingly everything is classified. And if classified, if secret, we know about it. Because we be trusted with it. a fine idea for an autocracy or dictatorship, but not so fine for a democracy. Government of the people, by the people, for the people? Impossible when nearly everything of any importance is classified. Too bad Hillary send everything in the clear what a service she would have done for the American people and for democracy!

Barking exclusively to WWN through an interpreter, Buster told us that there was more to his trampoline hijinks than meets the eye. an addiction, the adorable dog explained, always chasing the buzz of your first bounce. I loved it, I still enough of it. But tearing my life apart. Such was preoccupation with the trampoline, he lost interest in walks and even stopped marking his territory. There was a time you stop me from pissing on a tree. You name a tree in my area and cocked a leg over it, but once I took to bouncing nothing else mattered, I even lost contact with my mates in the dog park. My life is being controlled by this addiction, woofed Buster, flanked by his owners. Distraught, his owners contemplated removing the trampoline, but Buster would growl at any mention of it. Cautioning all owners and dogs not to make the mistakes he has made, Buster warned that there are many gateway hobbies which can lead to an all out trampoline addiction.
